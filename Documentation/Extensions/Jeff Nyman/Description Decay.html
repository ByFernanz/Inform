    <p>Provides a mechanism for allowing description levels to change based on number of visits</p>
    <p></p>
    </p>

    <p> This extension allows for a room description to &quot;decay&quot; in a gradual way, based on how often the player has seen the location.</p>

    <p> How this work is that the first time a room is gone to by the player, they will see the full description of the room. On the next time going to the room, the player will also see the description. However, you can provide a &quot;summary description&quot; for a room and if that is provided, this is what will always be used for the room's description the second time the player visits it.</p>

    <p> The third time the player visits the room, they will see no description at all. (This is akin to &quot;superbrief&quot; mode.)</p>

    <p> Of course, a &quot;LOOK&quot; command will always return the appropriate text of the location. However, the initial full description of the room is gated behind a check for whether the room is visited or unvisited. That means any subsequent looks will always rely on the summary description. You can use this extension with my Contextual Descriptions, which provides an &quot;impressions&quot; action that allows the player to recover the full text of the room.</p>

    <p> Something to note is that the way this logic works, it entirely overrides the description styles that players can usually choose. There are unabbreviated room descriptions (&quot;verbose&quot;, &quot;long&quot;), sometimes abbreviated room descriptions (&quot;brief&quot;, &quot;normal&quot;), and abbreviated room descriptions (&quot;superbrief&quot;, &quot;short&quot;). Using this extension means you want to control the display of descriptions by, in a sense, cycling through those various settings. In other words, by using this extension you are explicitly saying, as a design choice, you want the descriptions to &quot;decay&quot; rather than be in one mode.</p>

    <p> This example provides a lot of material and the raeson for that is try to include as many situations where the room description can change based on how it is setup, what is located in it, how the player gets to the room, and whether another character is tagging along. The best way to see this example in action is to play around with it, noting how the descriptions change.</p>

    <p> This example is also combined with my Contextual Descriptions extension and I did that to make that both can work together.</p>

    <p> The example test provided shows a few aspects. When the story first starts, you see the full description of the initial room (Palace Gate). The summarized aspects are showing the unvisited text.</p>

    <p> Going north then provides the full description of the Broad Walk. There is summarized elements for this room.</p>

    <p> Going south takes you back to Palace Gate and now you see that the summary description (rather than the full description) appears. The locale information continues to generate as expected. You can also note that the summarized text for Broad Walk shows while the summarized text for Flower Talk does not. This is because you have visited Broad Walk but you have not yet visited Flower Walk.</p>

    <p> Going east takes you to the Flower Walk. As normal you get the full description and the locale generates correctly.</p>

    <p> Going west now takes you back once again to Palace Gate. This time, crucially, NO description displays. The description has entirely decayed. This is because you have have seen the full description and the summary description. The locale displays as normal.</p>

    <p> Finally, the last &quot;look&quot; comand shows that the description does display. Here this is the summary description. Notice too that since you have now visited BOTH the Broad Walk and Flower Walk, the summarized descriptions display.</p>

    <p> If you wanted to recover the full description, you could use the &quot;impressions&quot; command. This is provided by Contextual Descriptions and makes sure that the initial impressions of the location can be recovered.</p>
