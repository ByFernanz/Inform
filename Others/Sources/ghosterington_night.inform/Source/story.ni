"Ghosterington Night" by Wade Clarke

[Chapter Hierarchy Reminder: It goes "volume", "book", "part", "chapter", "section"]

The release number is 3.

[Release 1 was the original Ectocomp version.

Release 2 was a Glulx update with title page, title music and gameplay refinements, and was compiled in Inform 6G60.

Release 3 is 99.9% the same game as release 2 (basically some typos and tiny source innefficiencies have been fixed) but its source code has been tweaked for compatibility with Inform 6L38, and I compiled it with 6L38.]

Use no deprecated features. [IE don't allow Inform commands/methods in the source which are due to be removed from the language in future releases. This keeps one programming safely, and also sometimes exposes iffy code in older extensions.]

Use no scoring. [I use my own score routines in this game. Admittedly, scoring is OFF by default in 6L38, but leaving this line in the source doesn't hurt.]

Release along with the source text.



[
TECH INFO ON COMPILING GHOSTERINGTON NIGHT
	
Release 3 of Ghosterington Night is the result of me updating the game's sourcecode for compatiblity with Inform 7 release 6L38 and recompiling it with 6L38. I did this in 2015.

(To see comments on bits of the source I specifically had to edit to make them 6L38 compatible, search for the square-bracekted tag [6L38] througout the source.)

Thanks to 6L38's game-specific extensions support, I've been able to include everything needed to compile the game in the download bundle. All required non-core extensions are in place and they won't interfere with any extensions already on your computer.

TO COMPILE THE GAME: Just save your copy of this source as 'ghosterington_night' and place it in the same location as the folder 'ghosterington_night.materials'. Make sure that you've ticked 'Glulx' as the Story File Format in the Settings tab, as well as the option to 'Bind up into a Blorb file on release'. Then click 'Go!' or 'Release'.

TO COMPILE THE GAME WITHOUT ITS TITLE GRAPHIC OR MUSIC FUNCTIONALITY: Just comment out the chapter of this source called "Book - Glulx title page and music code" in its entirety before compiling.

cheatmode is a truth state variable. cheatmode is false. [If I set this variable to true, cheat mode is on.]



Volume - Bibliography

The story genre is "Horror".

The story description is "Danger-filled Ghosterington Manor appears atop the same cliff each year on Samhain night. Hidden inside are the last four works of the dead bad poet Vigilance Ghosterington. Those four poems are worth a fortune, and you, famous adventurer Jubilee Grief, are determined to find them."

The story creation year is 2012.

Report requesting the story file version:
	say "Dice-Lock Version 1/080522 by S John Ross[line break]Useful Functions version 1 by ShadowChaser[line break]Extended Banner Version 5 by Stephen Granade[paragraph break]". [This line mentions extensions that I incorporated into the source and thus wouldn't get listed automatically by the VERSION command]



Volume - Test Phrases - Not For Release

wanting to cheat is an action out of world.
Understand "cheat" as wanting to cheat.

[presently, typing 'cheat' just sets a flag and reports the password animal's type and colour for the current game]

Carry out wanting to cheat:
	now cheatmode is true;
	say "[colpick] [anipick][line break]".

test me with "n/w/w/n/n/pull rug/x desk/s/shoot him/x shell/n/e/shoot him/x bed/e/shoot him/x vanity/s/shoot him/x plant/w/w/s/x a/x b/x mouth". [This test command tries to solve most of the game for you. Once you're on the clifftop, type 'test me'. Then, with a bit of luck (since the randomised enemies might manage to kill you en route) you'll run around a lot, not die, and end up standing beside the painting with 3 out of 4 poems and both clues in your inventory, ready to answer the painting's question.]



Volume - Core Extensions

Include Version 11 of Exit Lister by Eric Eve. [6L38] [This is the vanilla public library version 11 of this extension. Release 2 used version 9.]

Include Version 4 of Variable Time Control by Eric Eve. [6L38] [This is the vanilla public library version 4 of this extension. Release 2 used version 3.]

Include Version 7/140501 of Numbered Disambiguation Choices by Aaron Reed. [6L38] [This is the vanilla public library version 7/140501 of this extension. Release 2 used version 4.]

[6L38] [Release 2 used Ron Newcomb's 'Default Messages' extension. That extension's functionality is now built-in in 6L38, so I've recreated the tweaks I previously effected with that extension in the Book 'Changes to default Responses'.]



[I place any modifications of, and data for, extensions at the end of the source to reduce the amount of unexciting stuff I have to scroll through regularly.]



Volume - Out of world material

asking for help is an action out of world.
Understand "help", "hint", "hints" as asking for help.

The post competition version you are now playing, Release 2, retains the original game's design but has been significantly revised. It's better programmed and implemented, smoother and more reasonable (especially in terms of letting you look at the bad guys or do things like check your inventory without being killed) â€“ in short, it's more playable all around. I also added a title graphic and theme music.[paragraph break]";
	say "Andrew Schultz came up with a lot of the ideas for improvements and playtested this version. Michael Chu gave it a spin, too. Thanks also go to Jason Guest, who ran Ectocomp 2012, and to the folks who played or reviewed the original version of the game: Hulk Handsome, Jon Blask, Sam Kabo Ashwell, Emily Short, Sean M.

Volume - the uberstart rules

[The uberstart rules are just my way of organising what happens 'when play begins.']

The uberstart rules are a rulebook.

game_started is a truth state variable. game_started is false. [false means play hasn't begun yet, true means it has.]
colpick is a text variable. [the password animal's colour is stored here]
anipick is a text variable. [the password  animal's type is stored here]

The time of day is 10:27 PM. [set start time of game]

Rule for constructing the status line when game_started is false: do nothing. [keep status line blank until game is past the introductory stuff. If I don't do this, the status line will be displaying exits from the first room while the credits are still rolling]

When play begins:
	follow the uberstart rules.

An uberstart rule (this is the set the story viewpoint and tense rule):
	now the story viewpoint is second person singular; [6L38]
	now the story tense is present tense. [6L38]
	
An uberstart rule (this is the add the time to the status line rule):
	now right hand status line is "[time of day]".

An uberstart rule (this is the randomly pick a colour and animal for this game rule):
	choose a random row from table of firstword; [Choose password animal colour -]
	now colpick is hue entry; [and store it]
	choose a random row from table of critters; [Choose password animal type -]
	now anipick is beast entry. [and store it.]

An uberstart rule (this is the set the odds of terror statue appearing each turn rule):
	now statueodds is 5. [set odds of terror statue appearing each turn to 1 in 5]
	
An uberstart rule (this is the print part 1 of the introduction rule):
	clear the screen;
	say "Each year on Samhain night, Ghosterington Manor, the lair of legendary (and dead) bad poet, futurist and occultist Vigilance Ghosterington, materialises atop the same lonely cliff. It stays there for three hours, tempting adventurers to brave its dangers before disappearing at midnight for another year. It is said that Ghosterington's last four poems â€“ the worst he ever wrote, now worth millions of dollars â€“ are still inside the manor. But nobody has lived to bring them out.";
	say line break;
	say "This year is your year, for you are the famous adventurer and treasure finder Jubilee Grief, and you're determined to survive the dangers of Ghosterington Manor, find the poems, sell them and retire as a (more) famous millionaire.";
	waitforspace; [tell player to press space and pause til they do - this function comes from Shadowchaser's Useful Functions extension, included down near the end of the source.]
	say paragraph break;
	say ".  .  .[paragraph break]".

An uberstart rule (this is the print part 2 of the introduction rule):
	say "[bold type]Cliff face[roman type][paragraph break]A screaming wind lashes the cliff face as you ascend it with your anti-spelunking equipment. Suddenly a higher pitched squeaking pierces through to your ears. After your recent trip to the Amazon you'd know that sound anywhere: Killer vampire bats![paragraph break]";
	say "Without hesitation you whip out your six shooter and kick away from the cliff face, scanning for potential attackers. Three rapidly approaching dark shapes swing into view and you open fire â€“ BLAOW BLAOW BLAOW![paragraph break]";
	say "The three clipped bats flap and flail as they tumble to their deaths hundreds of feet below. You use your climbing pack to brace yourself as you swing back into the cliff, but the violent collision tears open a side pocket and your box of ammunition tumbles into space. Drat! Now you've only got the three bullets in your gun left to use in the house. Better make them count.[line break]";
	waitforspace;
	say paragraph break.



Book - Glulx title page and music code

[*** Comment out or delete this 'Glulx title page and music code' chapter of the source to remove the music and title graphic functionality.

This chapter checks the capabilities of the player's interpreter, displays the title page and/or plays the title song and/or displays messages about the interpreter's lack of graphics or audio support as appropriate. Then it asks the player to hit space if any multimedia was mobilised and fades out the music if it's still playing.]

Release along with cover art.

figure of titlepage is the file "cover800.png".
sound of titlemusic is the file "ghosterington_night.ogg".

Include Version 3 of Multiple Sounds by Massimo Stella.
Include Version 1/100607 of Real-Time Delays by Erik Temple.

faderflag is a truth state variable. faderflag is false. [Used to keep track of whether player pressed key at title page while music was still playing. If it was, I fade it out before continuing]
eyecandy is a truth state variable. eyecandy is false.
earcandy is a truth state variable. earcandy is false.

An uberstart rule (this is the dish out the introductory multimedia if the player's interpreter supports it rule):
	if glulx graphics is supported:
		now eyecandy is true; [note that player's interpreter has graphical capabilities]
	if glulx sound is supported:
		now earcandy is true; [note that player's interpreter has audio capabilities]
	if eyecandy is true:
		display the figure of titlepage;
	otherwise:
		say "(* The title image would appear here if you were playing this game in an interpreter with graphics support.)[paragraph break]";
	if earcandy is true:
		set the foreground volume to 5; [max volume]
		play sound of titlemusic in foreground;
		if glulx timekeeping is supported:
			now faderflag is true; [indicates that the theme song is currently playing]
			start a 20000 millisecond timer; [the theme song length is 20 seconds - IE after 20 seconds, faderflag will revert to 0, indicating that the song has played all the way through, which in turn means no fade out of the audio will be required]
	otherwise:
		if eyecandy is true:
			say line break;
		say "(* You would be hearing the theme music now if you were playing this game in an interpreter with sound support.)[paragraph break]";
	if eyecandy is false and earcandy is true: [if player has audio but no graphics -]
		say the banner info; [I display the game banner while the music is playing to stand in for the title graphic]
		say line break;
	if eyecandy is true and earcandy is true:
		say line break;
	if eyecandy is true or earcandy is true:
		say "<<  Press SPACE to begin  >>[run paragraph on]";
		get_the_space_key;
		if earcandy is true:
			if glulx timekeeping is supported and faderflag is true: [if player pressed SPACE and the music is still playing -]
				stop the timer;
				fade out the foreground sound; [fade out the music]
				now faderflag is false; [indicate music no longer playing]
			stop the foreground sound; [officially stop the music playing after the fade out is complete]
		say paragraph break.

A glulx timed activity rule (this is the NEW redirect from timer rule): [this overwrites what's in the Variable Time extension]
	now the waiting flag is false;
	stop the timer;
	now faderflag is false. [my addition - indicates that the theme music is no longer playing]

The NEW redirect from timer rule is listed instead of the redirect from timer rule in the glulx timed activity rules.

To fade out the foreground sound: [This routine is a manually programmed audio fade I worked out with a decent curve and refresh rate to minimise clicking of the audio. While the fade is occurring, the player can take no action.]
	say run paragraph on; [necessary to prevent linebumping in Gargoyle interpreter if music plays all the way to its conclusion]
	let CV be 66535;
	repeat with N running from 1 to 500:
		if CV is less than 1500, break;
		if CV is greater than 1500, now CV is CV minus 1000;
		if CV is greater than 5121, now CV is CV minus 2000;
		if CV is greater than 10241, now CV is CV minus 5000;
		if CV is greater than 20481, now CV is CV minus 7000;
		if CV is greater than 40961, now CV is CV minus 15000;
		set the raw foreground volume to CV;
		wait 110 milliseconds before continuing, strictly.

[NOTE: As of glk 0.7.3, the glk spec promised new audio functions, including built-in smooth fade capabilities. However, at the time I typed this, these new audio functions were barely supported by Inform at any level (I7 environment, I6 interfaces or player end interpreters) therefore I do not even try to use them. I will continue to use my 'manual' audio fades until such time as the built-in glk fades are more ubiquitously supported.]

[*** The section you would comment out ends with this very line you are reading.]



Book - The last uberstart rule

An uberstart rule (this is the start the game rule):
	now game_started is true. [this will allow the status line info to appear from now on]

Book - clockwork girl

clockstat is a number variable. [Value ranges from0-4: tracks the clockwork girl's master state.
0 = initial state where she's totally out of play
1 = she's primed to appear, and will do so at the first legal opportunity
2 = she's in the game now and following the player about and being a nuisance generally

	headkill.


To headkill:
	end the story saying "You died because you need a head to live and you have no head.";
	follow the shutdown rules. [If we don't follow the shutdown rules right now, the game will (annoyingly!) wait 'til next turn to end the story.]


Part - clockwork girl special programming

To decide if clockwork girl is dangerous:
	if clockwork girl is in location and clockstat is 2: [IE - if she is present in player's room AND not lying on the floor as a result of you pulling the rug out from under her]
		decide yes;
	decide no.


Rule for writing a paragraph about clockwork girl:
	if clockwork girl is dangerous and location is clockhistory:
		now clockwork girl is mentioned. [suppress normal line about clockwork girl's presence in the circumstance where an every turn rule is about to describe a special attack by her which the player will duck out of the way of. The attack occurred because the player backed into the last room the clockwork girl was seen in. See code below...]


Every turn:
	if clockwork girl is dangerous:
		if location is clockhistory: [If player returned to where clockwork girl was last seen...]
			if mulligan is true:
				say "The [clockwork girl] is still here in the room where you last saw her, her feet planted and her axe braced in readiness. With one great, sudden buzzing step whose strength and reach you fail to anticipate, she lops off your head.";
				headkill; [activate the 'decapitate the player' routine]
			otherwise:
				now mulligan is true;
				now clockhistory is clifftop; [effectively clears clockhistory]
				say "The [clockwork girl] has been idling here in the room where you last saw her. Suddenly she lurches forward, her axe soaring towards your neck --- you manage to duck back just in time, the blade passing under your chin. The [clockwork girl] starts to gather herself.[paragraph break]That was too close. You'll have to make sure she doesn't get the drop on you in future.";
				now clockfear is 0;
		otherwise:	
			say "Emitting an angry buzzing sound, the [clockwork girl] spins towards you and deftly removes your head with her axe.";
			headkill;
	if clockstat is 1 and location is proclock:
		say "You hear an alarming grinding and ticking sound as a silvery figure plods into the room. It's a [clockwork girl]. Her bloody metal face is stretched into a permanently agonised grimace. She's wielding an axe and looking at you.";
		introduce miss clock;
		now clockstat is 2;
	if clockfear is 1 and location is proclock and clockwork girl is not in location:
		introduce miss clock;
		say "The [clockwork girl] plods into the room. ";
		if location is plushroom:
			say "The rug muffles her footsteps.";
		otherwise:
			say line break.

To introduce miss clock:
	now clockwork girl is in location;
	set pronouns from clockwork girl; [since she didn't travel by the regular 'going' action, but by a cheapie code teleport, the game won't have set the pronoun 'her' to refer to her. So I do it manually.]
	now clockfear is 0.


Instead of pulling rug:
	if clockwork girl is dangerous:
		say "You yank the rug and the [clockwork girl] topples over. She thrashes about madly, whirring and clicking like an overturned beetle, but she's not flexible enough to get back on her feet.";
		now description of clockwork girl is "She's flopping about on the floor and making a tremendous amount of noise, but it doesn't look like she'll be able to get up again. You still need to keep away from her axe, though.";
		now clockstat is 4; [4 indicates she's stranded on the rug]
		rule succeeds;
	instead try taking rug. [programming for taking the rug already covers situations where (a) clockwork girl has been knocked over or is (b) not present]

Understand the command "yank" as "pull". [Add this synonym for 'pull']


Instead of pushing rug:
	if clockwork girl is dangerous:
		instead say "[no-time]A pull is likely to work better.";
	if clockwork girl is in location:
		instead say "[no-time]No, bunching the rug up against the clockwork girl wouldn't do anything to stop her waving that axe around.";
	otherwise: [she must not be present]
		say "There's nothing under the rug, but you note that it is loose on the floor.";
		rule succeeds.



Book - Terror Statue

statueprime is a number variable. [records consecutive turns spent in presence of Terror Statue]
statueodds is a number variable. [records chance of terror statue appearing each turn. It's set to 5 in the uberstart rules - IE 1 in 5 chance each turn.]
statuesafe is a number variable. [set this to 1 when player shoots terror statue to prevent him reappearing in same room]


Terror Statue is a man. "[Terror Statue] is here." Description of Terror Statue is "A tall white marble statue of a robed man. You want to lift your eyes to his face but you're too afraid to look.".

Understand "man/robed/marble/white", "robed/marble/white man/statue", "white marble man/statue" as terror statue.

terror statue wears robes. Description of robes is "They're snow white."
Understand "robe" as robes.

Terror Statue's face is a proper-named part of terror statue. Description of Terror Statue's face is "The fear you feel while in [Terror Statue]'s presence makes you too afraid to look!".
Understand "terror/terrors/terror's face", "statue/statues/statue's face", "terror statue face", "terror statues face", "terror statue's face" as terror statue's face.


Part - Terror Statue special programming

Every turn:
	lock the dice; [this is a basic (REAL basic) anti cheating measure powered by S John Ross's Dice-lock extension - if the player UNDOes a move after terror statue appears in hopes he won't appear if they replay that turn, he'll still appear. Of course that means the player could step into a room they didn't intend to visit and make him appear there, thus freeing up the room which was their original goal. Them's the breaks.]
	if terror statue is in location:
		increment statueprime;
		if statueprime is 2:
			terrorkill;
	if levpos is 1 and terror statue is not in location and statuesafe is 0 and location is proterror:
		if a random chance of 1 in statueodds succeeds:
			do statue arrival.


To set/now/change the/-- pronoun/-- it/its to/is/are/mean/means/refer/refers to/-- (character - an object): (- (SetPronoun('it',{character})); -). [with this bit of code, you can manually tell the game what the pronoun 'it' refers to, when relevant.]

To do statue arrival:
	now terror statue is in location;
	now statueprime is 1; [primes you to die by terror statue if you're still in the same room next turn]
	say "[one of]A white statue materialises in the room. Perspiration immediately breaks out on your forehead. You instinctively realise that this is the thing called [Terror Statue][or][terrorappears][stopping].";
	set pronouns from terror statue;
	now it means terror statue. [statue is a male, so if I want pronoun 'it' to refer to him just after he appears by cheapie teleport, I need to set it manually]

To say terrorappears:
	say "[Terror Statue] materialises in the room ";
	if location is plushroom and clockstat is 4:
		say "(not on the rug) ";
	say "and your heart skips a beat".

To terrorkill:
	say "A cold wall of pure fear is radiating from the statue. Your limbs tremble, your blood runs icy, then every part of you just stops at once.";
	end the story saying "You died at the inert hands of [Terror Statue].";
	follow the shutdown rules.



Book - Player post-movement routine

After going:
	if clockwork girl is in room gone from: [If player just left location of clockwork girl -]
		now clockhistory is the room gone from; [- note where they left her.]
	if clockstat is 0 and location is clockinducing: [If player is in a clockinducing room and clockwork girl hasn't been activated yet -]
		now clockstat is 1; [- prime the clockwork girl to appear at next opportunity.]
	now statuesafe is 0; [Clear player's temporary protection from terror statue if it was set in present location]
	now statueprime is 0; [Clear the record of time spent in presence of statue]
	if clockstat is 2: [If clockwork girl is operational -]
		now clockfear is 1; [- prime her to reappear in the next room  in which she's allowed to do so.]

Understand "get in/on" as entering.
Understand "get out/off/down/up" as exiting.
Understand "get [something]" as taking.
Understand "get in/into/on/onto [something]" as entering.
Understand "get off/down [something]" as getting off.
Understand "get [something] from [something]" as removing it from.


Instead of taking clockwork girl:
	say let's get sane.

Instead of taking Terror Statue:
	say let's get sane.

To say let's get sane:
	say "[no-time]That's beyond your power."

Before eating an inedible thing:
	say "[no-time]Let's get sane.";
	rule fails.



Book - SCORE

Check requesting the score:
	if poemfinds is:
		-- 0: say "You haven't found any of the four poems yet.";
		-- 4: say "You have all four poems. It's time to get out of here!";
		-- otherwise: say "You've found [poemfinds in words] of the four poems so far.";
	rule succeeds.



Book - SLEEP

Instead of sleeping:
	take no time;
	say "[lazybum]."

To say lazybum:
	say "Sleeping on the job is both unprofessional and potentially deadly"

Understand "sleep [text]" as a mistake ("[lazybum].").



Book - Time adjustments and the time limit

Carry out looking:
	if the room-describing action is the looking action and turn count is not 1, take no time. [what this line does: If player types LOOK, no time passes. but LOOKs automatically run by the game on entering a new room still allow time to pass, as they should. One special case: The LOOK carried out on the first turn of a game doesn't happen via the normal mechanisms and is therefore an exception which needs to be accounted for.]

Check examining:
	if noun is a verse or noun is a scrap:
		if clockwork girl is dangerous or terror statue is in location:
			instead say "You start to read [the noun] -[paragraph break]"; [player will die right after this message is printed, by one bad guy or the other]
	otherwise: [... reading redirects to examining, and it takes a minute, but all other EXAMINEs take no time]
		take no time. [This makes the default examining action a free move that doesn't trigger any enemy behaviour. The Ectocomp version of the game had no such niceties.]

Carry out taking inventory:
	take no time.


To redraw status line: (- DrawStatusLine(); -).

At 11:59 PM: [this action doesn't go off until the end of the 11:59 PM turn, which is really the start of the 12 AM turn. To make the status bar actually display 12 AM at this moment, I need to force it and redraw it:]
	now the time of day is 12:00 AM;
	redraw status line;
	say "[bold type]--- UH OH, IT'S MIDNIGHT ---[roman type][paragraph break]";
	if location is not clifftop:
		say "Ghosterington Manor vanishes and you vanish along with it.";
		end the story saying "You disappeared from the face of the earth.";
		follow the shutdown rules;
	otherwise: [if smartarse player never entered the manor in the first place -]
		say "Ghosterington Manor vanishes â€“ and you never even ventured inside!";
		end the story saying "You failed spectacularly.";
		follow the shutdown rules.


wanting the time is an action out of world.

Understand "time" as wanting the time.

Report wanting the time:
	say "It's currently [time of day]."



Volume - The Finale

To do the finale:
	if poemfinds is 0:
		end the story saying "You made it out alive, but you didn't retrieve any of the poems. Ghosterington Manor has triumphed for another year.";	
	otherwise:
		say "Thus ends [bold type]Ghosterington Night[roman type][paragraph break]";
		if poemfinds is 1:
			end the story saying "Good work! You retrieved one of the poems from the manor, the scissors poem. Its value is one million dollars. When the sun comes up, Ghosterington Manor is gone, and it's not a bad day to be you, Jubilee Grief, millionaire adventurer.";
		otherwise:
			say "You retrieved the following poems from the manor:[paragraph break]";
			say fixed letter spacing;
			say "    POEM                        MONETARY VALUE[line break]";
			let X be a number;
			let T be text; [6L38] [In 6G60 this had to be specified as 'indexed text'.]
			repeat with Y running through verses:
				if player holds Y:
					now T is "[The Y]";
					let N be number of characters in T;
					let D be 30 minus N;
					say "[T]";
					repeat with Z running from 1 to D:
						say " ";
					say "[worth of Y] million dollars[line break]";
					now X is X plus worth of Y;
			say "[line break]Total monetary value: [X] MILLION DOLLARS[paragraph break]Total cultural value: HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE";
			if poemfinds is 4:
				end the story saying "Congratulations! You retrieved all four poems from the manor and lived to tell the tale! When the sun comes up, Ghosterington Manor is gone, but it's truly a great day to be you, Jubilee Grief, millionaire adventurer.";
			otherwise:
				end the story saying "Great work! You retrieved [poemfinds in words] of the poems from the manor and survived!  When the sun comes up, Ghosterington Manor is gone, but it's a good day to be you, Jubilee Grief, millionaire adventurer.";
	follow the shutdown rules.

Volume - loser mode (an easter egg of sorts)

losermode is a number variable. [If player types XYZZY, the unfairly titled 'loser mode' is activated and the game's text output is deliberately messed up. This is how I jokily express my disaproval of people continuing to implement XYZZY in games.]

Wanting to lose is an action applying to nothing.

Understand "xyzzy" as wanting to lose.

Carry out wanting to lose:
	repeat with R running through rooms:
		now printed name of R is "xyzzy";
		now description of R is "xyzzy";
	repeat with R running through things:
		now printed name of R is "xyzzy";
		now description of R is "xyzzy";
		now initial appearance of R is "xyzzy";	
	now losermode is 1.

Report wanting to lose:
	say "'Don't say that,' booms an eldritch voice."
	
xyzzy is a privately-named backdrop. xyzzy is everywhere.
Understand "xyzzy" as xyzzy when losermode is 1.

Instead of doing anything to xyzzy: say "You feel confused."



Volume - Extension data and modifications

Book - Variable Time Control modification

[my below addition prevents 'every turn' rules going off if [no-time] was set during the turn. Without my addition, every turn rules go off irrespective of [no time] tags]

This is the NEW every turn stage rule:
	unless time-reset is true, follow the every turn rules.

The NEW every turn stage rule is listed instead of the every turn stage rule in the turn sequence rulebook.



Book - Changes to default Responses

The can't go that way rule response (A) is "[no-time][We] [can't go] that way."

The parser error internal rule response (A) is "Sorry? I didn't understand that."

Understand "sing" as a mistake ("One of your basic rules is 'Make no unnecessary noise when in a dangerous situation."). [6L38] [Singing was removed as a default action after Inform 6G60, but I had a special blocking response in place for it. Note that I don't add a 'no-time' instruction to this line because actions defined as 'mistakes' already take no time as far as Variable Time Control is concerned.]

The innuendo about squeezing people rule response (A) is "[no-time]No."

The block kissing rule response (A) is "[no-time]No."



Book - ShadowChaser's Useful Functions Extension Excerpts

Part - Keypresses and Space

To decide what number is the key_pressed: 
	let keypress be 0;
	while keypress is 0:
		let keypress be the chosen letter;
	decide on the keypress.

To decide what number is the key_pressed_with_question (question - some text):
	say "[question][line break]";
	decide on the key_pressed.

To get_the_space_key:
	let keypress be 0;
	while the infinite_loop is true:
		let keypress be the chosen letter;
		if keypress is 32, make no decision.

To WaitForSpace:
	say "[line break]<<  Press SPACE to continue  >>[run paragraph on]";
	get_the_space_key.


Part - Yes / No

To decide what text is the yesno_answer:
	let the answer be "MAYBE";
	let the exitvalue be 0;
	while the exitvalue is 0:
		let keypress be the key_pressed;
		if keypress is 89 or keypress is 121:
			let the answer be "YES";
			let the exitvalue be 1;
		otherwise if keypress is 78 or keypress is 110:
			let the answer be "NO";
			let the exitvalue be 1;
	decide on the answer.

To decide what text is the yesno_answer_with_question (question - some text):

	decide on the yesno_answer.

The infinite_loop is a truth state variable. The infinite_loop is true.


Book - Dicelock Extension by S John Ross (modified)

[I include this extension's code in Ghosterington's source rather than as an extension because the extension (version 1/080522) used a deprecated (soon to be extinct - and in fact, now actually extinct in Inform 6L38) Inform programming expression, and I forbid these in my games. The line which does the forbidding is up at the start of this source. Anyway, I removed the trouble expression from the extension's code and copied the altered code here into Ghosterington's source.]

DiceLock is a number variable.

When play begins: now DiceLock is a random number between 1000 and 9999.
   [Insures that random seeding will still vary from play-through to play-through]
   [With a seed less than 1000, Inform doesn't behave properly]

To lock the dice:
	Seed the random-number generator with DiceLock;
	Sprout the seed;
	If DiceLock is greater than 30000:
		now DiceLock is DiceLock divided by 29. [Recycles the DiceLock before it gets too high]

Before behaving randomly: lock the dice.

Verifying the story file is behaving randomly. [Replace or remove as needed]

To say RandomLock: lock the dice.

To sprout the seed:
	Increase DiceLock by a random number between 0 and 9;
	Increase DiceLock by a random number between 0 and 9;
	Increase DiceLock by a random number between 1 and 9. [all zeroes would be Bad]



Book - Extended Banner Version 5 by Stephen Granade (modified)

Section 1G (for Glulx only)

Include (-

[ SerialNumber i;
	for (i=0 : i<6 : i++) print (char) ROM_GAMESERIAL->i;

#endif;
#ifdef INFIX;
	print "X";

#ifdef DEBUG;
	print "D";
#endif;
];

-)

To decide if (s - text) is not blank: if s is "", decide no; decide yes.

[6L38] [The 'extended story headline' functionality from this extension broke at some point after Inform 6G60, so I just dispense with that code and manually print the words 'An Interactive Fiction' at the appropriate moment.]

To say story serial number: (- SerialNumber(); -).
To say I7 version number: (- I7BuildVersion(); -).

The story copyright string and story rights statement are text variables.

printed_banner is a number variable. [set this to 1 when the game banner is first printed to prevent any accidental reprints]

Last for printing the banner text rule (this is the extended banner rule):
	if printed_banner is 0:
		say the banner info.

To say the banner info:
	say "[bold type][story title][roman type][line break]An Interactive Fiction[if story author is not blank] by [story author][end if][line break]";
	say "Copyright [unicode 169] [story copyright string] by [story author][line break][story rights statement][run paragraph on][line break]";
	say "Release [if release number is not 0][release number][otherwise]1[end if] / Serial number [story serial number] / Inform 7 build [I7 version number][line break]";
	now printed_banner is 1.
