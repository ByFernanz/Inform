Section - Declarations
The bully is a monster that varies.
The dream-chest is a container.

Section - Start of the dream
The start the dream rule of dream of a bar in Montenoir is the start dream of a bar in Montenoir rule.

This is the start dream of a bar in Montenoir rule:
	repeat with items running through things enclosed by the player:
		unless item is part of the player:
			move item to dream-chest;
	move player to a bar in Montenoir;

	silently try wielding the tankard of grog;
	now the bully is a random off-stage talker monster whose level is 0 or 2 or 3;
	say "In your hand you find a tankard, containing a strong liquor.".

Section - Drunking
[The player will be drunk while he is in his dream (and hammered afterwards)]
Drunkstate is a kind of value.  The values of drunkstate are sober, tipsy, groggy, drunk and delirium tremens.
A person has a drunkstate that varies. The drunkstate of a person is usually sober.

hammeredturncounter is a number variable. hammeredturncounter is 0.
maxdrunkstate is a drunkstate that varies. maxdrunkstate is sober.

Every turn when hammeredturncounter > 0:
	decrease hammeredturncounter by 1;
	if hammeredturncounter = 0:
		now drunkstate of the player is the drunkstate before the drunkstate of the player;
		unless drunkstate of the player is sober:
			if the maxdrunkstate of the player is:
				-- tipsy: increase hammeredturncounter by 1;
				-- groggy: increase hammeredturncounter by 2;
				-- drunk: increase hammeredturncounter by 3.

A damage modifier rule when the drunkstate of the player is not sober (this is the drunken fighting rule):
	let x be 0;
	if the player is:
		-- tipsy:
			increase x by a random number between 0 and 1;
		-- groggy: 
			increase x by a random number between 0 and 2;
		-- drunk:
			increase x by a random number between 0 and 3;
		-- delirium tremens:
			increase x by a random number between 0 and 4;
	if hammeredturncounter > 0:
		now x is x multiplied by -1;
		say " [x] (delirium tremens modifier)[run paragraph on]";
	otherwise:
		say " +[x] (grog bonus while being [drunkstate of the player]) [run paragraph on]";
	increase the attack damage by x.

A defence modifier rule (this is the unpredictable defence when drunken rule):
	let x be 0;
	if the player is:
		-- tipsy:
			increase x by a random number between 0 and 1;
		-- groggy: 
			increase x by a random number between 0 and 2;
		-- drunk:
			increase x by a random number between 0 and 3;
		-- delirium tremens:
			increase x by a random number between 0 and 4;
	now x is x multiplied by -1;
	say "[if x <> 0] [x] ([drunklevel])[run paragraph on][end if]";
			increase the defence modifier by x.

To decide which text is the drunklevel:
	if hammeredturncounter > 0:
		decide on "delirium tremens";
	otherwise:
		decide on drunk state of the player.
		

Section - Tankard [The player may only fight with a tankard full of grog]

The tankard of grog is a weapon.

The description of the tankard of grog is "A heavy, stone beer tankard, engraved with the shield of Montenoir. In it, [If the drunkstate of the player is sober and the tankard is not empty]you find a rancid, foul smelling liquid. But perhaps it tastes better than it looks?[otherwise if the drunkstate of the player is tipsy and the tankard is not empty]you find something certainly not equal to a good wine, but you've had worse.[otherwise if the drunkstate of the player is drunk and the tankard is not empty]you find... wow... heavy stuff... [otherwise] a few drops of that heavy stuff.[end if] Drinking the liquid will make you hit your enemy harder, but will also make it harder to defend yourself.". Understand "grog" as the tankard of grog.

The damage die of the tankard is 6.
The weapon attack bonus of the tankard is -2.
The weapon damage bonus of the tankard is 1.
The dodge bonus of the tankard is 1.
The parry-against bonus of the tankard is -1.
The parry-with bonus of the tankard is -1.

The tankard of grog has a number called the current volume. The current volume of the tankard is 3. 

Definition: the tankard of grog is empty if the current volume of the tankard is 0.
Definition: the tankard of grog is full if the current volume of the tankard is 3. 


Understand "drink from [noun]" as drinking.

Instead of drinking the tankard of grog:
	if the tankard of grog is empty:
		say "You only see the bottom of the stein." instead;
	otherwise:
		unless the drunkstate of the player is drunk:
			now the drunkstate of the player is the drunkstate after the drunkstate of the player;
			now the maxdrunkstate is the drunkstate after the maxdrunkstate;
		now the current volume of the tankard is the current volume of the tankard minus 1;
		say "You take a firm gulp of the local liquor. It feels warm and burning to your throat.";
		if the drunkstate of the player is drunk:
			say "[run paragraph on] You feel a bit unsteady...".

Status attribute rule (this is the drunkstate status rule):
        if player is not sober:
                if long status is true:
                        say "You are [drunk state of the player]. [if drunkstate of the player is not delirium tremens]You generally do more damage and have less defence[otherwise]You are weak and unable to defend.[end if][line break][run paragraph on]";
                otherwise:
                        say "[@ check initial position of attribute][drunkstate of the player][run paragraph on]".
