The announce colophon rule is not listed in any rulebook.


Chapter - Dealing with restore

After restoring from a saved game:
	reset the Glulx timer.[Kerkerkruip doesn't use the standard library restore code, so we need to reproduce Glimmr Canvas Animation's restore protection here.]


Chapter - Setting background colors for Gargoyle

To open up the graphics-window:
	if graphics-window is g-unpresent and the main-window is ancestral to graphics-window:
		set the Gargoyle background color to the color g-black;
		open up graphics-window;

Before window-shutting the graphics-window:
	if the graphics-window is g-present:
		set the Gargoyle background color to the color g-white;


Chapter - Assets

A figure name has a number called the y-offset. The y-offset of a figure-name is usually 0.[It is not necessary for all figure-names to get this property, but a bug in Inform--http://inform7.com/mantis/view.php?id=1067--prevents us from referring to the property if it is not defined in this way.]

Chapter - Graphics support

Full graphics support is a truth state variable.

Rule for starting the virtual machine (this is the graphics support rule):
	if glulx graphics is supported and glulx graphic-window mouse input is supported and glulx timekeeping is supported and glulx PNG transparency is supported:
		now full graphics support is true.



Section - Setting graphics preferences from the command line

The main menu graphics are an option. Understand "graphics" and "graphical menu" as the main menu graphics.
Understand "menu [option]" as toggling.

Check toggling the main menu graphics:
	if main menu graphics are enabled:
		try disabling the main menu graphics;
	otherwise:
		try enabling the main menu graphics;

Check enabling the main menu graphics:
	if full graphics support is false:
		say "Unfortunately your interpreter can't display the graphical menu." instead;
	if screen reader mode is enabled:
		say "The graphical menu is disabled in screen reader mode." instead;
	if main menu graphics are enabled:
		say "The graphical menu is already turned on." instead;
		
Check disabling the main menu graphics:
	if full graphics support is false:
		say "Unfortunately your interpreter can't display the graphical menu." instead;
	if screen reader mode is enabled:
		say "The graphical menu is disabled in screen reader mode." instead;
	if main menu graphics are disabled:
		say "The graphical menu is already turned off." instead;

Carry out enabling the main menu graphics:
	enable the main menu graphics flag;
	say "The graphical menu is now turned on." instead;

Carry out disabling the main menu graphics:
	disable the main menu graphics flag;
	say "The graphical menu is now turned off." instead;



Chapter - Session flag

Carry out restarting the game (this is the set session flag on restart rule):
	[This sets a flag that we can check--and reset--to decide whether or not to show the title animation before the main menu.]
	enable session flag.

[We need to do the same thing in the immediately restart the game rule, which is a bit trickier since it is an I6 rule in the template layer. We need to replace the template rule with a routine that will set the session flag.]

[ IMMEDIATELY_RESTART_VM_R;
	((+ data-value setting +)-->1)(6,1);
	@restart; 
];
-) instead of "Immediately Restart VM Rule" in "OrderOfPlay.i6t".

First finally quitting the game rule (this is the set session flag on quit rule):
	[We set the session flag to 0 on quit. This will almost never be necessary, but it helps assure that we will see the animated title on starting a new session.]
	disable session flag.


Chapter - Set up the graphics window
[We don't want to see the main text window at all until the game proper begins. Strictly speaking, we should probably hack the Inform library to allow for this--but that is not a minor undertaking. Instead, we will simply open the graphics window so that it covers the main text window entirely (note the 100 measurement below--this indicates that the graphics window will be split off from the main window at 100% of the latter's height). The Glulx Status Window Control extension suppresses the opening of the status window; we will open it later, only after closing the graphics window.]

The graphics-window is a graphics g-window spawned by the main-window. The position of the graphics-window is g-placeabove. The measurement of the graphics-window is 100. The back-colour of the graphics-window is g-black. The graphics-window is g-graphlinked.

[These rules prevent any graphics window from updating during animation other than the graphics-window. This is to prevent border windows, which are graphics windows, from being animated during music fadeouts, principally when graphics are not enabled but the player's interpreter is capable of using them.]
The animation window-updating rule is not listed in any rulebook.

For updating graphics windows for animation (this is the specific animation window-updating rule):
	Follow the window-drawing rules for the graphics-window.


Chapter - Animation code support

Section - Easy delays

The pause track is an animation track.

To pause for (T - number) milliseconds/ms, accepting input:
	animate the pause track as a temporalizing animation at 130 ms per frame[8fps] with a duration of (T / 130)frames;
	if accepting input:
		wait for main menu input until all animations are complete;
	otherwise:
		delay input until all animations are complete.

[For updating graphics windows for animation when pause track is animation-active (this is the don't refresh windows while we are merely holding rule):
	#if utilizing animation debugging;
	say "[>console][bracket]Kerkerkruip[close bracket]: Graphics drawing suppressed (don't refresh windows while we are merely holding rule).[<]";
	#end if;
	do nothing.]
	

Chapter - Menu control

Menu-active is a truth state variable.
Redraw-menu is a truth state variable. Redraw-menu is false.

[To decide what sound-name is the music selected by the player:
	say "Please select background music: [line break]";
	let count be a number;
	repeat with tune running through sound-names:
		increment count;
		let T be indexed text;
		let T be "[tune]";
		replace the text "Sound of " in T with "";
		say "   ([count]) [T][line break]";
	while 1 is 1:
		let k be the character code entered in the main-window - 48;
		if k is less than (count + 1) and k is greater than 0:
			now count is 0;
			repeat with tune running through sound-names:
				increment count;
				if k is count:
					decide on tune.]

For showing the title screen when full graphics support is true and main menu graphics are enabled (this is the graphic title screen rule):
	shut down the status-window; [needed on restart]
	close side windows; [needed on restart]
	open up the graphics-window;
	open up the graphics-window;
	if the session flag is enabled:
		disable the session flag;

	set JUMP POINT redraw_menu;
	now menu-active is true;
	now redraw-menu is false;
	shut down the status-window; [for returning from a text menu]
	close side windows;[probably not necessary here, but added for future-proofing.]
	open up the graphics-window;[it is possible that it may be closed on return from a menu]
	fade in the main menu;
	pause for 2000 milliseconds, accepting input;
	if the number of entries in the monster-card queue is greater than 0:
		if menu-active is true:
			transition to monster card gallery;
		if menu-active is true:
			animate monster cards;
	otherwise if menu-active is true:
		show startup instructions;
	if redraw-menu is true:
		JUMP to redraw_menu;
	otherwise:
		clear the main-window;[we don't want to see old content in the main window when the menu closes]
		close title screen;
		[open the status window.]

To set jump point redraw_menu:
	(- .RedrawMenu; -)
	
To jump to redraw_menu:
	(- jump RedrawMenu; -)

To menu-start new game:
	if the file of save data exists:
		delete file of save data;
		unless difficulty is less than 2:
			set difficulty to (difficulty - 1);

To menu-continue game:
	do nothing.

To menu-quit game:
	clear the main-window;[Some interpreters will show the main window after we've quit, so we handle that.]
	say "Thank you for playing Kerkerkruip!";
	close title screen;
	stop game abruptly.

To menu-request help menu:
	now the current menu is the Table of Kerkerkruip Help;
	close title screen;
	carry out the displaying activity.

To menu-request options menu:
	now the current menu is Table of Options Menu;
	close title screen;

[The map is available even if the player has indicated that he doesn't want main menu graphics. There is no reason to disable it, since a player can always choose whether she wants it. It is of course not available if there are no graphics at all.

The map window is modal--the game can't be played while the window is open, and the game text is not visible.]

The map-window is a graphics g-window spawned by the main-window. The position is g-placebelow. The measurement is 100. The back-colour is g-black. The arbitrary scaling factor is 1.0000. The map-window is g-graphlinked.

The map-canvas is a g-canvas. The associated canvas of the map-window is the map-canvas.

Section - Command to show the map

Showing the map is an action out of world. Understand "map" and "show the/-- map" and "m" as showing the map.

Check showing the map:
	unless the map can be shown:
		say "Your interpreter does not offer full graphics support, so the map is not available. Try using the REMEMBER command (R for short). Here it is:[paragraph break][input-style-for-glulx]>REMEMBER[roman type][line break]";
		try remembering instead.

Carry out showing the map:
	follow the dungeon extent calculation rules;
	shut down the status-window;
	close side windows;
	set the Gargoyle background color to the color g-black;
	open up the map-window;
	follow the glulx arranging rules;
	while true is true:
		let keystroke be the character code entered in the main-window;
		if the display status of the left_arrow is g-active:
			if keystroke is -2[left arrow]:
				scroll map west;
				next;
			if keystroke is -3[right arrow]:
				scroll map east;
				next;
		if the display status of the up_arrow is g-active:
			if keystroke is -4[up arrow]:
				scroll map north;
				next;
			if keystroke is -5[down arrow]:
				scroll map south;
				next;
		break.

To scroll map (dir - direction):
	if dir is north[up arrow]:
		now scroll-offset-y of the map-renderer is scroll-offset-y of the map-renderer + map-tile-height;
	if dir is south[down arrow]:
		now scroll-offset-y of the map-renderer is scroll-offset-y of the map-renderer - map-tile-height;
	if dir is east[right arrow]:
		now scroll-offset-x of the map-renderer is scroll-offset-x of the map-renderer - map-tile-width;
	if dir is west[left arrow]:
		now scroll-offset-x of the map-renderer is scroll-offset-x of the map-renderer + map-tile-width;
	if scroll-offset-x of the map-renderer is greater than max-scroll-offset-x of the map-renderer:
		now scroll-offset-x of the map-renderer is max-scroll-offset-x of the map-renderer;
	if the scroll-offset-x of the map-renderer is less than (0 - the max-scroll-offset-x of the map-renderer):
		now scroll-offset-x of the map-renderer is (0 - max-scroll-offset-x of the map-renderer);
	if scroll-offset-y of the map-renderer is greater than max-scroll-offset-y of the map-renderer:
		now scroll-offset-y of the map-renderer is max-scroll-offset-y of the map-renderer;
	if the scroll-offset-y of the map-renderer is less than (0 - the max-scroll-offset-y of the map-renderer):
		now scroll-offset-y of the map-renderer is (0 - max-scroll-offset-y of the map-renderer);
	follow the window-drawing rules for the map-window.

Report showing the map:
	shut down the map-window;
	set the Gargoyle background color to the color g-white;
	open side windows;
	open up the status-window;
	if there is a display-inactive size-sensitive g-element[i.e., if we have had to hide any of the UI elements, the map window was too small]:
		say "[bracket]The window was too small to show the map comfortably. Try increasing the size of your game window.[close bracket][line break]";
	say "Map consulted.";
	


Section - Calculating the size of the dungeon

The ordered dungeon manifest is a list of rooms variable.

The dungeon extent calculation rules are a rulebook.

A dungeon extent calculation rule (this is the basic dungeon extent rule):
	calculate the extent of the dungeon;
	order the manifest of dungeon rooms;
	#if utilizing Glimmr debugging;
	say "[>console]Kerkerkruip: Dungeon extent:[line break]x: [Extent-minimum-x] / [Extent-maximum-x][line break]y: [Extent-minimum-y] / [Extent-maximum-y][line break]z: [Extent-minimum-z] / [Extent-maximum-z].[<]";
	#end if;
		
To order the manifest of dungeon rooms:
	now the ordered dungeon manifest is {};
	repeat with z running from extent-maximum-z down to extent-minimum-z:
		repeat with x running from extent-maximum-x down to extent-minimum-x:
			repeat with y running from extent-minimum-y to extent-maximum-y:
				repeat with place running through map-ready rooms:
					if x-coordinate of place is x and y-coordinate of place is y and z-coordinate of place is z:
						add place to the ordered dungeon manifest.

To repeat with (loopvar - nonexisting K variable)
	running from (v - arithmetic value of kind K) down to (w - K) begin -- end
	(documented at ph_repeat):
		(- for ( {loopvar}={v}: {loopvar}>={w}: {loopvar}-- )  -).


Section - Scaling rule for the map window

Map-tile-width is a number variable. Map-tile-width is usually 32.
Map-tile-height is a number variable. Map-tile-height is usually 16.

For scaling the map-window (this is the resize canvas to map viewport rule):
	now the canvas-width of the map-canvas is the width of the map-window;
	now the canvas-height of the map-canvas is the height of the map-window;
	#if utilizing Glimmr debugging;
	say "[>console]Kerkerkruip: Scaling the map-canvas to [canvas-width of the map-canvas] x [canvas-height of the map-canvas].[<]";
	#end if;
	continue the action.


Section - Drawing rule for the map object

The map-renderer is a g-element. The associated canvas is the map-canvas. The graphlink status of the map-renderer is usually g-active. The display-layer is 1.

[The map-offset is a number, dynamically set, that allows us to center the map in the window.]
The map-renderer has a number called map-offset-x.
The map-renderer has a number called map-offset-y.
[The scroll-offset is a number that allows us to adjust the placement of the map in response to player input.]
The map-renderer has a number called scroll-offset-x.
The map-renderer has a number called scroll-offset-y.
[The max-scroll-offset is the maximum the map can scroll in any direction.]
The map-renderer has a number called max-scroll-offset-x.
The map-renderer has a number called max-scroll-offset-y.
[The width and height of the map are stored each time the map is displayed. They will mostly be useful for applying effects to the finished map.]
The map-renderer has a number called map-width.
The map-renderer has a number called map-height.
[Now, local coordinate min-max for the map as whole. (Local in the sense that it doesn't take account of the offsets needed to center in the window, or to scroll the map using keys.)]
The map-renderer has a number called map-min-x.
The map-renderer has a number called map-max-x.
The map-renderer has a number called map-min-y.
The map-renderer has a number called map-max-y.

[The z-shift is changed as the map is drawn--we use it to increase screen-y to place each successive floor beneath the floor above.]
The map-renderer has a number called z-shift.

[The level-y-adjustment is the amount that we need to subtract from the vertical offset for each level of the dungeon. This ensures that levels do not contain empty vertical space above the drawing.]
The map-renderer has a number called level-y-adjustment.

The map-renderer has a table name called the avatar-table.

The enemies list is a list of people variable.

To reset the scrolling offsets:
	now the scroll-offset-x of the map-renderer is 0;
	now the scroll-offset-y of the map-renderer is 0;
	now the max-scroll-offset-x of the map-renderer is 0;
	now the max-scroll-offset-y of the map-renderer is 0.

An element display rule for the map-renderer (this is the map display rule):
[In the room coordinates, the y-coordinate refers to west-east, whereas y in the screen model is top-bottom, so the room coordinates must be swapped between x and y. The x-axis must also be reversed for drawing, since it increases in the wrong direction vis-a-vis the screen model.]

Section - Small Map Window
[If the map window is too small, we hide some elements to make it maximally useful.]

A g-element can be size-sensitive. A g-element is usually not size-sensitive.

To compensate for small map window:
	if the width of the map-window is less than 690:
		repeat with item running through size-sensitive g-elements:
			deactivate the item;
	otherwise:
		repeat with item running through size-sensitive g-elements:
			activate the item.


Section - Map Title

The map-title is a sprite. The associated canvas is the map-canvas. The origin is {25, 10}. The image-ID is Figure of map_text_title. The display-layer is 10. The map-title is size-sensitive.


Section - Compass rose

The map-compass-rose is a sprite. The associated canvas is the map-canvas. The origin is {15, 10}. The image-ID is Figure of map_text_compass_rose. The display-layer is 10. The map-compass-rose is size-sensitive.

First element scaling rule for the map-compass-rose (this is the position compass rose at bottom of screen rule):
	now entry 2 of the origin of the map-compass-rose is (height of the map-window - 66).

The position compass rose at bottom of screen rule is listed first in the element scaling rules.


Section - Keyboard instructions

The map-keyboard-instructions are a sprite. The associated canvas is the map-canvas. The origin is {0, 0}. The image-ID is Figure of map_text_arrow_keys. The display-layer is 10. The map-keyboard-instructions are center-aligned.


Section - Scroll buttons
[Scroll buttons are not quite like the buttons on the main menu--they don't have a depressed state, and they are shown as either active or inactive. So we define a new kind for them.]

A map-button is a kind of sprite. A map-button has a figure-name called the active state. A map-button has a figure-name called the inactive state.  A map-button has a number called the x-off. A map-button has a number called the y-off. The display status of a map-button is g-inactive. The associated canvas of a map-button is the map-canvas. The graphlink status of a map-button is g-active. The display-layer of a map-button is 11. 

Some map-buttons are defined by the Table of Arrow Buttons.

Table of Arrow Buttons
sprite	image-ID	active state	inactive state	x-off	y-off
down_arrow	Figure of map_button_down_arrow_active	Figure of map_button_down_arrow_active	Figure of map_button_down_arrow_inactive	124	11
left_arrow	Figure of map_button_left_arrow_active	Figure of map_button_left_arrow_active	Figure of map_button_left_arrow_inactive	109	-6
right_arrow	Figure of map_button_right_arrow_active	Figure of map_button_right_arrow_active	Figure of map_button_right_arrow_inactive	141	-5
up_arrow	Figure of map_button_up_arrow_active	Figure of map_button_up_arrow_active	Figure of map_button_up_arrow_inactive	124	-21


To set up the map keyboard instructions:
	now the image-ID of the map-keyboard-instructions is Figure of map_text_any_key;
	repeat with item running through map-buttons:
		now the image-ID of the item is the active state of the item;
		deactivate the item;
	if the map-width of the map-renderer is greater than (width of the map-window - legend-width of the map-legend) - map-tile-width:
		now the max-scroll-offset-x of the map-renderer is (map-tile-width * 3) + (((map-width of the map-renderer - (width of the map-window - legend-width of the map-legend)) / map-tile-width) * map-tile-width);
		now the image-ID of the map-keyboard-instructions is Figure of map_text_arrow_keys;
		activate the left_arrow;
		activate the right_arrow;
		if the scroll-offset-x of the map-renderer is greater than the max-scroll-offset-x of the map-renderer - 1:
			now the image-ID of the left_arrow is the inactive state of the left_arrow;
		if the scroll-offset-x of the map-renderer is less than (1 - the max-scroll-offset-x of the map-renderer):
			now the image-ID of the right_arrow is the inactive state of the right_arrow;
	if the map-height of the map-renderer is greater than (height of the map-window - 142):
		now the max-scroll-offset-y of the map-renderer is MAX (map-tile-height) or (map-height of the map-renderer - (height of the map-window - 142));
		now the image-ID of the map-keyboard-instructions is Figure of map_text_arrow_keys;
		activate the up_arrow;
		activate the down_arrow;
		if the scroll-offset-y of the map-renderer is greater than the max-scroll-offset-y of the map-renderer - 1:
			now the image-ID of the up_arrow is the inactive state of the up_arrow;
		if the scroll-offset-y of the map-renderer is less than (1 - the max-scroll-offset-y of the map-renderer):
			now the image-ID of the down_arrow is the inactive state of the down_arrow;
	let horizontal center be (width of the map-window - legend-width of the map-legend) / 2;
	let vertical anchor be the height of the map-window - 42;
	now entry 1 of the origin of the map-keyboard-instructions is the horizontal center;
	now entry 2 of the origin of the map-keyboard-instructions is the vertical anchor;
	if the image-ID of the map-keyboard-instructions is Figure of map_text_arrow_keys:
		repeat with item running through map-buttons:
			now entry 1 of the origin of the item is the horizontal center + the x-off of the item;
			now entry 2 of the origin of the item is the vertical anchor + the y-off of the item.


Section - Graphic links for scrolling

Graphlink processing rule for up_arrow:
	scroll map north.

Graphlink processing rule for down_arrow:
	scroll map south.

Graphlink processing rule for right_arrow:
	scroll map east.

Graphlink processing rule for left_arrow:
	scroll map west.


Section - Map Legend

The map-legend is a g-element. The associated canvas is the map-canvas. The display-layer is 2.

The map-legend has a number called the legend-width. The legend-width is 250.

An element display rule for the map-legend (this is the map legend display rule):
	draw a rectangle (11316396[40% gray]) in the map-window at (width of the map-window - legend-width of the map-legend) by 0 with dimensions legend-width of the map-legend by (height of the map-window);
	draw a rectangle (6447714[70% gray]) in the map-window at (width of the map-window - legend-width of the map-legend) by 0 with dimensions 2 by (height of the map-window);
	let x be (width of the map-window - legend-width of the map-legend) + 10;
	let y be 93;
	display Figure of map_text_legend_title in the map-window at ((x - 10) + (legend-width of the map-legend / 2) - (image-width of Figure of map_text_legend_title / 2)) by (y - 90);
	repeat with villain running through alive seen denizen persons:
		unless the villain is the player:
			display the legend-label of the villain in the map-window at x by y;
			increase y by the image-height of the legend-label of the villain plus 0;
	unless the number of dead persons is 0:
		if the number of alive seen denizen persons is greater than 0 and y is less than (height of map-window / 2):
			increase y by 12;
		repeat with villain running through dead seen persons:
			let offset be the image-height of the legend-label of the villain / 2;
			display the legend-label of the villain in the map-window at x by y;
			draw a rectangle (15461355[10% gray]) in map-window from x by (y + offset) to (x + image-width of the legend-label of the villain) by (y + offset) + 1;
			increase y by the image-height of the legend-label of the villain plus 0.


Section - Map window redraw

A glulx redrawing rule when the map-window is g-present (this is the reset map scrolling offsets on forced redraw rule):
	reset the scrolling offsets;
	compensate for small map window;
	set up the map keyboard instructions;
	continue the action.

A glulx arranging rule when the map-window is g-present (this is the reset map scrolling offsets on window arranging rule):
	reset the scrolling offsets;
	compensate for small map window;
	set up the map keyboard instructions;
	continue the action.


Section - Test command for map window (for use with Extended Debugging by Erik Temple)

Revealing the entire map is an action out of world. Understand "reveal map" or "reveal full map" or "full map" as revealing the entire map.

Carry out revealing the entire map:
	now all placed not nogo rooms are map-revealed;
	now all placed not nogo rooms are visited;
	now all placed not nogo rooms are enemy-revealed;
	now all alive not off-stage persons are seen;
	if the eternal prison is not placed, now the nameless horror is not seen;
	try showing the map.


Section - Testing for graphics assets (for use with Extended Debugging by Erik Temple)

Last when play begins:
	repeat with place running through rooms:
		if place is not a tunnel and place is placeable:
			if place provides the property map-label:
				if the map-label of place is Figure of Null:
					say "[place] has no map label image.";
			otherwise:
				say "[place] does not provide the map-label property. Check to be sure that it will be labeled properly on the map.";
	repeat with villain running through persons:
		if villain is not the player and villain is not a god:
			if villain provides the property card and (level of villain > 0 and level of villain < 6):
				if the card of the villain is Figure of Null:
					say "[villain] has no card image.";
			if villain provides the property avatar:
				if the avatar of villain is Figure of Null:
					say "[villain] has no avatar image.";
			otherwise:
				say "[villain] does not provide the avatar property. Check to be sure that it will be labeled properly on the map.";
			if villain provides the property legend-label:
				if the legend-label of villain is Figure of Null:
					say "[villain] has no legend label image.";
			otherwise:
				say "[villain] does not provide the legend-label property. Check to be sure that it will be labeled properly in the map legend."
