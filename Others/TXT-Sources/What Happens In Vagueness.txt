It is carried by the player.The description is "[one of]'Treasure Huntery Lesson 1: Maps' is a slim pamphlet that gives just the basics. You've read it a thousand times, but it never hurts to have it on hand.[or]'The first thing any treasure hunter needs is a map. It's no good to just go looking for treasure with no idea of where to look! You may be skeptical about the existence of actual treasure maps, but in fact the people who hid treasure generally wanted to be able to find it again, or even to let their heirs or accomplices find it in the event that they could not. This doesn't mean they made it easy!'[or]'For one thing, the maps are often nearly as well-hidden as the treasures themselves. However, that doesn't mean you're left to search aimlessly. The purpose of the map is defeated if no one has access to it, so treasure maps can usually be found among the effects of the treasure-hiders, or in places they frequented. Look in residences, gathering-places, and vehicles.'[or]'Once you've found your map, the next step is deciphering it. Treasure maps are usually encrypted or obfuscated in some way. Edgar Allan Poe's short story [italic type]The Gold Bug[roman type] tells about a map that has instructions written in code... and also in invisible ink!'[or]'Invisible ink is actually surprisingly common in authentic treasure maps -- and one of the main reasons that there are still treasure maps that have gone undetected. The most popular form of invisible ink is ordinary lemon juice, although any weak acid works just as well. When heat is applied to the paper, the parts weakened by the lemon juice discolor more quickly. There are recorded attempts at developing an ink that would work the other way around, but to our knowledge this has never been done successfully.'[or]'Code-breaking can seem daunting, but the fact is, most encoded messages on treasure maps use simple substitution ciphers. The key to breaking these is to look for the most common letter in the text. That will almost invariably represent E, the most common letter in nearly every western language. Of course, if the message is very short, this approach can prove impossible.'[or]Hm. This thing doesn't seem as useful as you remember it. And what's up with using [italic type]The Gold Bug[roman type] as an example? Isn't that fictional?[cycling]".Chapter 5 - Debugging - not for releaseTest wh5 with "get map and mug and bottle / fill mug with vinegar / fill bottle with rum / pour vinegar on map / look at map through bottle"Section Skip - not for releaseInstead of skipping ahead during Whisper 5:   say "Skipping Scene 5";   now the map is developed;   now Luxor-Aware is true.Part 6 - The One-Armed Time Bandit by Michael MartinWhisper 6 is a scene.
