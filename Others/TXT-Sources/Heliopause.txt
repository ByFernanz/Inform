This source code is provided for personal, educational use only. The story and text of _Heliopause..._ belong to me; you may not use them or create derivative works which contain them. However, you have permission to use the programming techniques of this game in your own works, and you may use the source code excluding game text.

If you want to *play* this game, you're in the wrong place. Go to my web site: <http://eblong.com/zarf/zweb/heliopause/>

Obvious warning:  This code contains spoilers! If you haven't played _Heliopause..._, and you read this code, you'll certainly ruin the game for yourself. Play it first. I am releasing this code for the benefit of Inform programmers who are familiar with the game and want to know how I did it.

This source code was written for Inform 7, build 5Z71. I have not tested it with later I7 releases. (I started writing it in May of 2010. A newer I7 release appeared just as I began beta-testing, and I didn't think it was worth upgrading and re-testing everything.)

Some 10% of this file is Inform 6 code. It's not as bad as it looks. I needed to change a single line of Parser.i6t, and the best way to do it was to paste in the whole 350-line function and then make the change.
]

When play begins:
    say "Myrmidal is the queen of the bright worlds, and you've walked her million cities beneath her sky and beyond it. Myrmidal laughs and Myrmidal dances; they say no one weeps on Myrmidal, except for moments on the stage.[para]";
    say "But even on Myrmidal the sun rises and sets, and the music grows tinny and harsh when you weary of dancing. Your best stories and your best lies draw the same fond laughter. This morning you decide to rise to the docks, and rouse your [HorizonOfNight] from her sleep, and raise her sails. Somewhere are worlds you have never seen. And if your friends miss you at the dance, they can tell you so when you return."

The player is in Myrmidal.

Chapter - Utilities

Release along with cover art.

Use serial comma.
Use American dialect.
Use full-length room descriptions.
Use no scoring.

[Some textual shortcuts.]

To say para -- running on:
    (- DivideParagraphPoint(); new_line; -).

To say That-Those (T - thing):
    if the noun is the player:
        say "You";
    else if the noun is plural-named:
        say "Those";
    else:
        say "That".

To say That-Those-are (T - thing):
    if the noun is the player:
        say "You are";
    else if the noun is plural-named:
        say "Those are";
    else:
        say "That is".

[The open-bracket/close-bracket stuff is to permit italics in stored text buffers. I will explain the text buffers anon.]

To say Horizon:
    if z-buffering:
        say "[bracket]Horizon[close bracket]";
    else:
        say "[italic type]Horizon[roman type]".

To say HorizonOfNight:
    if z-buffering:
        say "[bracket]Horizon of Night[close bracket]";
    else:
        say "[italic type]Horizon of Night[roman type]".

When play begins:
    now the right hand status line is "[status line desc]".

Rule for constructing the status line:
    do the substitute status line work.

The description of the player is "You are an improved model."

Definition: a room is non-location if it is not the location.

Definition: a thing is non-equipment-scenery if it is scenery and it is not equipment.

Rule for deciding whether all includes scenery: it does not.

Last does the player mean doing something with non-equipment-scenery:
    it is unlikely.

[Disable the brief and superbrief commands.]

Check preferring unabbreviated room descriptions:
    instead say "[italic type][Story title][roman type] does not support the 'brief' or 'superbrief' modes. You will always see long descriptions of locations."

Check preferring abbreviated room descriptions:
    instead try preferring unabbreviated room descriptions.

Check preferring sometimes abbreviated room descriptions:
    instead try preferring unabbreviated room descriptions.

Chapter - I6 Work

[I didn't feel like including Basic Screen Effects, so here's the one-line version:]

To wait for keystroke: (- VM_KeyChar(); -).

[I didn't feel like using regexps, so here's a simple I6 routine to turn "?" and "!" into periods in the input. This lets the player type "set sail!"]

After reading a command: depunctuate the command.
To depunctuate the command: (- DepunctuateBuffer(); -).

Include (-
[DepunctuateBuffer ix len addr;
    len = buffer->1;
    addr = buffer+2;
    for (ix=0 : ix<len : ix++) {
        if (addr->ix == '!' or '?')
            addr->ix = '.';
    }
];
-).

[A little bit of hackery to right-justify the right-hand part of the status line.]

To do the substitute status line work: (- SubstituteStatusLine(); -).

Include (-
[ SubstituteStatusLine width len ix addr;
    width = VM_ScreenWidth();
    VM_MoveCursorInStatusLine(1, 2);
    switch(metaclass(left_hand_status_line)) {
        String: print (string) left_hand_status_line;
        Routine: left_hand_status_line();
    }
    len = VM_PrintToBuffer(StorageForShortName, 80, right_hand_status_line);
    addr = StorageForShortName + WORDSIZE;
    VM_MoveCursorInStatusLine(1, width - (len+1));
    for (ix=0 : ix<len : ix++)
        print (char) addr->ix;
];
-).

Include (-
[ LanguageVerb i;
    switch (i) {
      'i//','inv','inventory':
               print "take inventory";
      'l//':   print "look";
      'x//':   print "examine";
      'z//':   print "wait";
      default: rfalse;
    }
    rtrue;
];

[ LanguageVerbMayBeName w;
    if (w == 'long' or 'short' or 'normal' or 'brief' or 'full' or 'verbose' or 'sail')
        rtrue;
    rfalse;
];
-) instead of "Commands" in "Language.i6t".

[This giant NounDomain inclusion is really just to add a single function call to a single line in the library routine:
   
    if ((0 ~= j&1) && ~~LanguageVerbMayBeName(first_word)) ...
   
What's going on? If the player types "raise", the game will respond "What do you want to raise?" and we want "sail" to be a valid response. But normally a verb response aborts the disambiguation prompt and gets parsed on its own. "Sail" is a verb in this game. So we need a special test.]

[I didn't feel like using indexed text, so here's some code to push text (the room description) into a buffer and reprint it later. I need this because many room descriptions are randomly generated, but I want them to be consistent if the player types "look" repeatedly.

Room descriptions occasionally contain italics, so I had to do some extra work to encode the "style underline" and "style roman" commands into the buffer. They are encoded as open-bracket and close-bracket.]

Chapter - Values

[These values are used in randomly generating stars.

I wanted to include "yellow-white" and "blue-white" as possible star colors, but I7's property-value parsing wasn't quite up to the job. To make myself feel better, I added a "blue-white" star later in the game -- but its color is actually white. I added the "blue" and "blue-white" synonyms by hand.]

Color is a kind of value.

The colors are no-color, red, orange, golden, yellow, white, blue.

Understand "gold" as golden.

Table of Star-Appropriate Colors
Color
red

A color-modifier is a kind of value.

The color-modifiers are no-modifier, pale, dim, bright.

A star-descriptor is a kind of value.

The star-descriptors are no-star-desc, fat, swollen, large, plain, small, petite, tiny.

Chapter - Credits Stuff

Abouting is an action out of world applying to nothing.

Understand "about" as abouting.
Understand the command "credits" as "about".

Report abouting:

    say "[italic type][Story title][roman type] is copyright 2010 by Andrew Plotkin (erkyrath@eblong.com). It may be distributed for free, but not sold or included in any for-profit collection without written permission from the author.[para]";
    say "I presented this game as a work-in-progress at the Grue Street IF writer's workshop (http://pr-if.org/); the feedback was invaluable. Beta playthroughs were offered by Emily Short, Dan Efran, Jake Eakle, Kevin Jackson-Mead, and Sarah Morayati. My thanks to them and to everyone who helped out.[para]";
    say "The cover art is a composition of the Cat's Eye Nebula (NASA, ESA, HEIC, and The Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA), 2007) and a [italic type]Celestial Map of the Northern Sky[roman type] (Albrecht Dürer, 1515)."


To decide whether the game ended in victory:
    decide yes.

Rule for amusing a victorious player:
    say "How many nautical-style actions did you try? The game recognizes quite a range, mostly things you can do to sails: 'raise', 'lift', 'hoist', 'heave', 'haul', 'spread', 'widen', 'broaden', 'lower', 'unfurl', 'unfold', 'unreef', 'reef', 'narrow', 'furl', 'fold', 'trim', 'tauten', 'slacken', and 'rig'. You can also say 'set sail', 'strike sail', 'more sail', or 'less sail'. Or simply 'sail' or 'sail forth'.[para]";
    say "The ship will move if you say 'go', 'fly', 'forward', 'ahead', or even 'push on' or 'forge onward'. You can 'go to', 'fly toward', 'vector toward', or 'steer toward'.[para]";
    say "But don't try 'warp 8'. That would be silly."

Chapter - Actions

[The action structure in this game is kind of monstrous.

This section defines a whole slew of new actions, including flying, launching, inwarding (moving towards a planet), outwarding (moving away from a planet), raising and lowering, etc. Many standard actions redirect to these; "go in" becomes inwarding, "go out" becomes outwarding, and so on. Launching also redirects to outwarding. These are just examples. There's a whole mess of actions that redirect to other actions.

Then *those* action redirect to a different set, the abstract actions, which are defined in the next section. The abstract actions aren't directly typable by the player; they do all the actual work. Except in the cases when they don't.

The wait-counter is a number that varies.

Check waiting when the location is Lightless:
    increase the wait-counter by one;
    if the wait-counter is at least three:

Chapter - Abstract Actions

[The abstract actions are planet-departing, planet-arriving, system-leaving, system-entering, and travelling. These are the five phases of space flight, and cover all of the movement in the game.]

The planet-cause-mentioned is a thing that varies.
The travel-cause is an action-name that varies.
Every turn:
    now     the planet-cause-mentioned is nothing;
    now the travel-cause is the drinking action.

A room can be unsmugged or smugged. A room is usually unsmugged.

Planet-departing is an action applying to nothing.

Check planet-departing when the location is not a planet:
    instead say "(BUG) You are not on a planet."

Check planet-departing when the location is not looted:
    if the location is:
        -- Planet-1: instead say "You certainly cannot leave this world without collecting some token[one of][or] of the life you have discovered[stopping].";
        -- otherwise: instead say "Surely it is worth collecting something before you depart."

Carry out planet-departing:
    if the planet-cause-mentioned is the anchor:
        say "You [one of]raise[or]hoist[or]heave[cycling] anchor.";
    now the ship is boarded;
    now the anchor is raised;
    if the location is Myrmidal:
        say "The anchor precesses.[para][Horizon] shakes, waking the speed which has slept these past years. Myrmidal's magnetic halo bucks her keel high; high and out through the rings of city and industry and careless Myrmidal society. When the anchor falls into place along the keel, [Horizon] rings bell-clear, and the sky is black.";
        move the player to Myr-system;
    else:
        let S be a random system that overlays the location;
        move the player to S;
    if the location is unsmugged:
        now the location is smugged;
        if the location is:
            -- System-1: say "This iridescent substance is an enthralling start to your journey. Even d'Accord technology cannot create all things, and a new form of matter may benefit lives across the bright worlds. If the stars before you are as rich in wonders as this, you will be a nine-days[apostrophe] wonder when you return home.";
            -- System-2: say "The fluid luminescence is unique in your memory and experience. The light, together with the iridescent cloth -- discoveries like these will assure your fame.";
            -- System-3: say "Civilizations are fragile, and the relics of an unknown race -- a people who might have bloomed billions of years past, in the cold unlight of a dwarf star -- these tablets must be incalculably valuable. You are torn: should you come around, and begin the journey back to the bright worlds?[para]But so much remains out there for you to take. Just one more discovery. Perhaps two.";
            -- otherwise: say "(BUG) No smug message.";

Planet-arriving is an action applying to nothing.

Check planet-arriving when the location is not a system:
    instead say "(BUG) You are not near a planet."

Check planet-arriving when the location is Myr-system:
    instead say "The last thing you want is to return to Myrmidal."

Check planet-arriving when the location is Lightless:
    instead say "You have no idea if there's anywhere within light-years to anchor."

Carry out planet-arriving:
    let S be a random planet that underlies the location;
    if S is:
        -- Planet-1: say "You drop the anchor. [Horizon] curves gracefully in to meet the gas giant in its orbit.";
        -- Planet-2: say "You drop the anchor; [Horizon] swings slowly into the asteroid belt. You maneuver towards the odd planetoid.";
        -- Planet-3: say "You drop the anchor. [Horizon] glides in towards the dwarf star and its icy companion.";
        -- otherwise: say "You drop the anchor. [Horizon]'s orbit curves gracefully sunward.";
    now the anchor is lowered;
    move the player to S.

System-leaving is an action applying to nothing.

Check system-leaving when the location is not a system:
    instead say "(BUG) You are not in an outer system."

Check system-leaving when the location is an unlooted system:
    instead say "But you just got here!"

Check system-leaving when the location is Lightless:
    if Lightless is zlit and the compass is fixed and the current-sail is new-sails:
        instead end it;
    if the current-sail is no-sails:
        instead try examining no-sails;
    if Lightless is unzlit and the compass is broken:
        instead say "You have sails, but [if the compass is he-unknown][he-discover]no helium for your[else]no[end if] compass. In any case, the darkness around you is absolute; you can see nowhere to steer.";
    if Lightless is unzlit:
        instead say "The darkness around you is absolute; you can see nowhere to steer.";
    if the compass is broken:
        instead say "Without [if the compass is he-unknown][he-discover]helium for your[else]a functioning[end if] compass, you will never arrive anywhere.";
    instead say "(BUG) Can't go home."

Carry out system-leaving:
    let R be Myrmidal;
    if the location is Myr-system:
        say "The sails begin to unfurl. They catch sunlight. The [HorizonOfNight] shifts gladly around her keel, and slides into interstellar space.";
        let R be a random non-location room in Journey-One-Beginning;
        regenerate R;
    if the location is System-1:
        say "You hoist the sails once again. [Horizon] swings outward from [the star-1], into the spaces beyond.";
        let R be Periphery;
        regenerate R;
    if the location is System-2:
        say "You raise sail to pulsar-light. [Horizon] rides a long crest out through the nebula and into the star-clusters beyond.";
        let R be Elder;
    if the location is System-3:
        say "You hoist the sails once again. Slowly, the infrared glow of the dwarf fills them, and [Horizon] moves out into the galactic halo.";
        let R be Roiling;
    if R is Myrmidal:
        instead say "(BUG) Don't know how to leave [location].";
    now the spreadness is one;
    now the tightness is two;
    move the player to R.

System-entering is an action applying to nothing.

Check system-entering when the spreadness is 3:
    now the travel-cause is the sleeping action;
    say "You vector for the star. But [Horizon]'s velocity is too great; you whip past the star in a shallow hyperbola, and are flung away into the void[one of][or]. You'll have to reef sail before you can make orbit[stopping].[run paragraph on]";
    instead try travelling.

Check system-entering when the location is To-Tighter:
    instead say "The binary star system has no planets."

Check system-entering when the location is Roiling:
    say "You vector for the supergiant. [Horizon]'s fast approach compresses its history. Carbon roils in the star's atmosphere; shock-waves roll in fast-forward across its surface.";
    instead suffer disaster.

Carry out system-entering:
    if a star (called S) is in the location:
        let R be the star-system of S;
        if R is no-system:
            instead say "(BUG) [The S] has no star-system.";
        say "You furl your sails, and descend into [the S]'s outer system.";
        now the spreadness is zero;
        now S is in R;
        move the player to R;
    else:
        say "(BUG) There is no star here."

Travelling is an action applying to nothing.

Check travelling when the location is a planet:
    instead say "(BUG) Can't travel on the ground."

Check travelling when the spreadness is zero:
    if the location is a system:
        instead try raising the current-sail;
    instead say "Only set sail, and you will."

Carry out travelling:
    carry out the travel activity.

        -- otherwise: say "(BUG) Unknown tightness [spreadness].";

[The travel activity takes care of all of the travelling actions (all movement which is not planet-arriving/departing or system-entering/leaving). I used an activity so that I could add rules incrementally as the game developed.]

Travel is an activity.

Rule for travel when the location is in Journey-One-Beginning and spreadness is less than three:

Chapter - Starship Props

[The "starship" object. This is a backdrop (everywhere) which has the other ship-equipment (keel, compass, sails, etc) as component parts.

(The three treasures are *not* kept in the ship; they're actually your normal inventory.)]

The ship is a backdrop. The printed name is "[Horizon]".

Understand "horizon", "of night", "starship", "spaceship", "star ship", "space ship", "sailer" as the ship.
Understand "hold", "hull", "equipment" as the ship.

The ship is everywhere.
The ship can be boarded.

The description of the ship is "[ship-description]."

    if N is zero:
        instead say "You have nothing on board [Horizon][if the ship is boarded] but yourself[end if].";

Instead of putting something on the ship:
    instead try taking the noun.
Instead of inserting something into the ship:
    instead try taking the noun.

Chapter - Equipment Props

[The various pieces of the ship. This section also includes some equipment-specific verbs, such as "weigh anchor" and "set sail".]

Equipment is a kind of thing. Equipment is scenery.

Check taking equipment:
    instead say "[That-Those-are noun] a part of the [Horizon]."

Check rubbing equipment:
    instead say "Starships don't need regular scrubbing."

Check tasting equipment:
    instead say "Don't lick the starship. It's tacky."

The spreadness is a number that varies.
The tightness is a number that varies.

When play begins:
    now the anchor is part of the ship;
    now the current-sail is old-sails;
    now the current-sail is part of the ship;
    now the keel is part of the ship;
    now the compass is part of the ship;
    now the controls is part of the ship;
    now the sensors is part of the ship;
    now the anchor is lowered;
    now the spreadness is zero;
    now the tightness is two.


The controls are plural-named equipment.

Instead of doing anything to the controls:
    say "You know the controls by heart. You do not have to think about them."

Understand "control", "console", "consoles", "couch" as the controls.

The sensors are plural-named equipment.

Understand "screen", "viewscreen", "viewer", "sensor", "senses", "scanner", "scanners", "longscan" as the sensors.

Instead of doing anything except examining, searching, repairing to the sensors:
    say "You know the controls by heart. You do not have to think about them."

Check examining the sensors:
    instead try looking.
Check searching the sensors:
    instead try looking.

Check repairing the sensors when the location is Lightless:
    instead say "It's hopeless. The only senses [Horizon] has left are your eyes."

The keel is equipment. The description is "[if the location is not Lightless]The keel runs the [Horizon]'s length, its rhodomagnetic core and axis[else]The keel seems to be whole, to your relief[end if]."

Understand "core", "axis" as the keel.

Instead of pulling, pushing, turning the keel:
    say "Fly the ship, and the keel will take care of itself."

Instead of touching, listening to the keel:
    say "The keel hums with [if the location is a planet]restrained power[else]the power of [Horizon]'s flight[end if]."

Check repairing the keel when the location is Lightless:
    instead try examining the keel.

The compass is equipment. The description is "[he-discover][if the compass is unbroken]The compass rests in its bath of liquid helium. Subtle magnetic fields stir between the stars, a sailor knows, and the compass shifts on their breath[else if the compass is broken]The compass housing is ridged with barely-healed scars. It must have cracked in the disaster; most of its superfluid helium has boiled away[one of]. If the ship had not managed this repair, the entire compass assembly might have been hopelessly quenched. No doubt the course-memory of your travels has been lost. But[or]. At least[stopping] the mechanism itself looks sound[else]The compass housing is ridged with barely-healed scars, but it is sealed, and you have refilled it with liquid helium. It should function, though you may never recover the inertial memory[end if]."

Understand "bath", "liquid", "superfluid", "helium" as the compass.

The compass can be unbroken, broken, or fixed.

The compass can be he-unknown or he-known. The compass is he-unknown.

To say he-discover:
    now the compass is he-known.

Instead of touching, turning, pushing, pulling the compass:
    say "It is wiser not to touch the equipment whose operating temperature is a quarter-degree above absolute zero."

Check melting the compass:
    instead say "The compass is [italic type]supposed[roman type] to be cold."

Check repairing the compass when the location is Lightless:
    if the compass is broken:
        instead say "The compass mechanism doesn't need to be repaired. It only needs to be refilled.";
    else:
        instead say "It's as repaired as it's going to get."

The anchor is equipment. The description is "Your anchor is a disk of whirling strange matter[if the location is Lightless]. It doesn't seem to have been damaged; it's secured by the keel[else if the anchor is lowered]. It's dug deeply into the bent space-time of [local-planetary-orbit], holding the [Horizon]'s keel in its frame[else]. It's secured by the keel, edge-on so that it slips without drag through space-time[end if]."

Understand "disk", "strange", "matter" as the anchor.

The anchor can be raised or lowered.

Check turning the anchor:
    instead say "If the anchor weren't spinning, it wouldn't exist."

Check touching the anchor:
    instead say "It feels like strange matter."

Anchor-raising is an action applying to one thing.
Understand "weigh [something]" as anchor-raising.
Understand the command "precess" as "weigh".

Does the player mean anchor-raising the anchor:
    it is likely.

Check anchor-raising the anchor:
    instead try raising the anchor.
Check anchor-raising the compass:
    instead say "Precessing the compass would be a bad, bad idea."
Report anchor-raising:
    say "[That-Those-are noun]n't the anchor."

To say local-planetary-orbit:
    if the location is Myrmidal:
        say "Myrmidal's";
    else:
        say "your";
    say " planetary orbit";

Instead of dropping the anchor:
    try lowering the anchor.

Instead of taking the anchor:
    say "(raising the anchor)";
    try raising the anchor.

Instead of pulling the anchor:
    try raising the anchor.

Instead of pushing the anchor:
    say "(lowering the anchor)";
    try lowering the anchor.

Check raising the anchor when the anchor is raised:
    instead say "The anchor is already raised[one of], and secured by the keel[or][stopping]."

Check raising the anchor when the anchor is lowered:
    instead try planet-departing.

Check lowering the anchor when the anchor is raised:
    if the location is a planet:
        instead say "(BUG) Landed but anchor raised.";
    if the location is a system:
        instead try planet-arriving;
    if the location is To-Tighter:
        instead say "The binary star system has no planets.";
    if the location is solar-curious:
        instead say "You are too far out to drop anchor. Steer towards that star, maybe, first.";
    if the location is Nebula-Heart:
        instead try entering the pulsar;
    instead say "Out here? There's nowhere in sight to anchor."

Check lowering the anchor when the anchor is lowered:

Chapter - Environments

[This section defines some useful kinds: planets and systems (which are rooms), planet-props and stars (which are scenery objects that go in the rooms.) Also the ubiquitous "stars" backdrop.

A room with a desc-generator rule has a randomized description. We generate a new room description when the room is entered, and store the text in a buffer. (This happens in the travelling action.) We can then print the text if the player types "look".]

A room has a rule called the desc-generator. The desc-generator is usually the default-desc-generator rule.
A room can be desc-generated.

This is the default-desc-generator rule:
    say "(BUG) This room has no description generator."

To regenerate (R - room):
    now R is unvisited;
    now R is desc-generated;
    let G be the desc-generator of R;
    fill room buffer with G.

To fill room buffer with (G - rule): (- FillZBuffer(z_buffer_room, Z_BUFLEN_ROOM, {G}); -).

To say the room buffer: (- PrintZBuffer(z_buffer_room); -).

Before printing the locale description of a desc-generated room:
    say the room buffer.

A planet is a kind of room.

Definition: a planet is looted unless it is unlooted.
Definition: a planet is unlooted if a treasure is in it.

A system is a kind of room. No-system is a system.

Planet-system relates one planet to one system.
The verb to underlie (it underlies) implies the planet-system relation.
The verb to overlay (it overlays) implies the reversed planet-system relation.

Definition: a system is looted if it overlays a looted planet.
Definition: a system is unlooted if it overlays an unlooted planet.

Definition: a room is solar-systemic if it is a planet or it is a system.

Definition: a room is solar-curious if it is not a planet and it is not a system and it contains a star.

A star is a kind of thing. The printed name is "[star-printed-name]".

To say star-printed-name:
    let S be the item described;
    if the star-descriptor of S is not no-star-desc:
        say "[star-descriptor of S] ";
    if the color of S is not no-color:
        say "[color of S] ";
    say "star".

To regenerate (S - star):
    now S is no-modifier;
    now S is no-star-desc;
    choose a random row in the Table of Star-Appropriate Colors;
    let C be the color entry;
    now S is C;
    if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds:
        now S is a random color-modifier;
    let N be 2;
    if S is no-modifier:
        now N is 4;
    if a random chance of N in 5 succeeds:
        now S is a random star-descriptor.

Instead of entering a star:
    if the location is solar-curious:
        instead try system-entering;
    else:
        instead say "The inside of a star is more exotic an adventure than you are prepared for."

Check melting a star:
    instead say "Stars are hot enough already, really."

Instead of doing something other than examining, listening, melting, or entering to a star:
    say "That makes no sense."

Does the player mean entering a star:
    it is likely.

A planet-prop is a kind of thing. A planet-prop is scenery.
Understand "planet", "world" as a planet-prop.

Instead of entering a planet-prop:
    instead try planet-arriving;

Instead of pushing, pulling, turning a planet-prop:
    instead say "It's really too big for that."

Instead of touching, searching a planet-prop:
    instead say "You haven't landed."

Does the player mean entering a planet-prop:
    it is very likely.

Carefully, you lower the line onto the first of the frozen helium tablets. The thermal gradient shifts; the priceless artifact begins to melt.[para]The arrangement works perfectly, of course. One by one, the tablets liquefy and are drawn up into the compass. By the time the last one is gone, the helium bath is full enough to function.";
    instead say "Destroying the tablets would be an incalculable loss."

Filling is an action applying to one thing.
Understand "fill [something]" as filling.
Understand "fill [something] with/from [something]" as inserting it into (with nouns reversed).

Understand the commands "refill", "recharge" as "fill".

Report filling:
    say "[That-Those noun] can't contain things."

Check filling the compass:
    if the compass is not broken:
        instead say "The compass is already full.";
    if the player carries the tablets:
        instead try melting the tablets;
    instead say "(BUG) How?"

Instead of inserting the tablets into the compass:
    try melting the tablets.
Instead of putting the tablets on the compass:
    try melting the tablets.

Instead of inserting the compass into the compass:
    say "The liquid helium[if the compass is broken] -- what's left of it --[end if] is already in the compass."

Instead of inserting the liquid into the compass:
    say "[if the compass is broken]The compass needs to be filled, but it[else]The compass[end if] doesn't run on liquid light."
Instead of putting the liquid on the compass:
    say "[if the compass is broken]The compass needs to be filled, but it[else]The compass[end if] doesn't run on liquid light."

Instead of inserting something into the compass:
    say "[That-Those noun] won't fit into the compass."
Instead of putting something on the compass:
    say "[That-Those noun] won't fit into the compass."

Chapter - Disaster

[The endgame.]

Roiling is a room. The printed name is "Approaching Roiling Star".

The description is "A rare sight drifts into view, far ahead: a red supergiant guttering on the edge of catastrophe. It is a crimson, billowing cauldron of turbulent fire -- pulsing irregularly, choked with helium and carbon ash."

The boom-star is a star in Roiling. The printed name is "red supergiant". The color of the boom-star is red.
The description is "The star is in the last stages of its lit life. The core must be long exhausted of hydrogen. Heavier elements now burn within, in their ragged, quickening cycles of fire.[para]If this star has anything to offer, you should seek it now. It will not last another thousand years."

Understand "giant", "super", "supergiant", "cauldron", "fire", "turbulent", "crimson", "roiling" as the boom-star.

Known-broken is a truth state that varies. Known-broken is false.

To decide whether not-yet-known-broken:
    if known-broken is false:
        now known-broken is true;
        decide yes;
    else:
        decide no.

To suffer disaster:
    say "[line break]By the time you see oxygen and argon boiling into the red star's corona, it is too late to turn aside. The light of fusing metals washes over [Horizon], and the shockwave is only fractionally behind.";
    say "[line break]... ";
    wait for keystroke;
    say "[line break]";
    now the spreadness is zero;
    now the compass is broken;
    remove the old-sails from play;
    now the current-sail is no-sails;
    now the current-sail is part of the ship;
    now the player is in Lightless.

Lightless is a system. The printed name is "[if zlit]Debris[else]Darkness[end if]".

Lightless is smugged.
Lightless can be unzlit or zlit. Lightless is unzlit.

The description is "[one of]Lights appear on the control consoles, one by one. [HorizonOfNight] is coming back to life. The walls around you are dim and radiation-scarred; you have no idea how long it's taken the ship to recover enough function to support you. But you are awake. You stretch in your couch, shudder, and take stock.[para]Outside is blackness, pure and opaque[or][dark-prop-desc][stopping]."

The dark-prop is scenery in Lightless. The printed name is "darkness".

The description is "[dark-prop-desc]."

To say dark-prop-desc:
    if Lightless is unzlit:
        say "You are surrounded by blackness, pure and opaque. Whatever corner of space you've been flung into, it's dense enough to block all starlight. Only the vague thermal wash of microwaves reassures you that the universe is out there at all";
    else:
        say "You are surrounded by thick, swirling debris. It is dangerous, but";
        if the compass is broken and the current-sail is no-sails:
            say " you might navigate it -- if you had [if the compass is he-unknown][he-discover]helium for your[else]a[end if] compass. And sails";
        else if the current-sail is no-sails:
            say " you might navigate it -- if you had sails to raise";
        else if the compass is broken:
            say " you might navigate it -- if you had [if the compass is he-unknown][he-discover]helium for your[else]a[end if] compass";
        else:
            say " you are sure you can navigate it[one of][or]. Time to set sail, and see[stopping]";

Understand "dark", "darkness", "black", "blackness", "pure", "opaque", "thermal", "wash", "microwave", "space" as the dark-prop.
Understand "debris" as the dark-prop when Lightless is zlit.

Instead of inserting the liquid into the dark-prop:
    try opening the liquid.
Instead of putting the liquid on the dark-prop:
    try opening the liquid.
Instead of throwing the liquid at the dark-prop:
    try opening the liquid.

Check entering the dark-prop:
    if Lightless is zlit:
        instead try flying;
    else:
        instead say "You are already in the darkness."

Instead of doing anything except examining, entering to the dark-prop:
    say "Impossible."

Chapter - Epilogia

To wait it out:
    let N be the number of treasures carried by the player;
    if N is:
        -- 3: say "You wrestle with the question; but in the end, you refuse to sacrifice your treasures to [Horizon]'s repair. Whether that is avarice or respect, you will not decide until you awaken.";
        -- 0: say "You have already sacrificed all of your treasures. Is this shame, or a belated repentance? You will not decide until you awaken.";
        -- otherwise:
            if the compass is broken:
                say "You wrestle with the question; but in the end, you refuse to sacrifice the ancient tablets to [Horizon]'s repair. Whether that is avarice or respect, you will not decide until you awaken.";
            else:
                say "The tablets were perhaps the greatest of your discoveries, and they are gone. But you stop short -- is this shame, or a belated repentance? You will not decide until you awaken.";
    say "[line break]You set the cryohold to chill you down, and prepare to sleep through the years -- or centuries, or millennia -- until rescue might come.";
    end the game saying "Waiting it out".

To end it:
    say "You hoist the sails -- what has yet survived your touch -- and bring [HorizonOfNight] under way.";
    say "[line break]... ";
    wait for keystroke;
    say "[para]";
    say "You are not so far from Myrmidal, at this end of your wandering. You pass by suns on the way home; they do not hold your interest, not long enough to slow [Horizon] in its course. And there are the sails, to be sure. You leave a trail of vapor in your wake, as the iridescent fabric decays. Delay is no temptation now.[para]";
    say "In the end, it is the touch of Myrmidal's solar wind that brushes the last shreds of sail away.[para]";
    say "[Horizon] falls across the system, through the staticky noise of civilization, until the patrol tenders match your course and bring you in tow. They jibe your ill luck, and offer you the gossip of your centuries outward-gone. You swap them stories of treasures found; floating creatures and icy ruins; the sound a ship's sails make as they explode in supernova-light. The patrollers laugh and applaud a lie well-told. You leave it at that.[para]";
    end the game saying "Home".
