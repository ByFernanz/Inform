Chapter of Known Issues

[WISHLIST, TO-DOs, and KNOWN ISSUES

* ENTER and IN are treated differently at the quayside. Hrm. Oops.
* I really want to add a single-line mode (where the status line is just one line, as an option for limited interpreters), and in Release 7 I took a stab at it, hoping to combine it with an "always scrolling" mode more reminiscent of traditional text adventures, but the combination proved too daunting to the game's assumptions about line and paragraph spacing, and in at least one case caused an awful bug where the game was depending on a "look" action automatically accompanying movement. I have preserved that version of the code in a separate file, though, to revisit it someday.
* Sometimes (not consistently) generic descriptions will assign a gender to inanimate objects. To see this in action, REGARD THE GUARD in the MARKETPLACE, then go north and REGARD THE ROCKS. Repeat until it happens. It seems to be that the gender-marker is lingering from the GUARD. Have tried a few fixes, but none seem to do the trick.
* USE FLASHLIGHT ON CRAWLWAY delivers a generic parser error, due to the way the crawlway is "implemented" (which is to say, not at all).
* In GIT (but not in the version of GIT used by Gargoyle), monsters with long names cause a half-glyph error in the battle bar. The monsters in question are the GIANT SNOW-SERPENT, SCHOOL OF SKY-PIRANHA and VIRAXIAN HELL-SOLDIER).]

Chapter of Release Notes

[These notes are by no means exhaustive. Sometimes I remember to note things here, and sometimes I don't, so there are probably some important things I never thought to jot down in the heat of development.

RELEASE 9 CHANGES

* Changed references to my old email address (sjohn@io.com) to one that actually still works and should for the long haul (sjohn@cumberlandgames.com) ... let's hope I remember to fix the documentation on the same point!
* Added "creatures" to the synonyms for the rabble of CITIZENS in the port (and etc), paused to puzzle how it took me this long to notice that noun just sitting there in the room description. D'oh.

RELEASE 8 CHANGES

* Fiddled back and forth with a couple of the KILLFIRST items to make the changes fit, as usual. Also, added some subordinate sections moving some of those items into default for Glulx compilation (each one marked so that, hopefully, I'll remember they're not REALLY Glulx-specific, just more-space-available specific).
* The "HintStinky" scene now only takes place if the Barbarian has the PYREXIAN EYE and VIRAXIAN INCENSE, with some other conditions relaxed, but is now limited to the SEASHORE instead of anywhere the SEA is visible (it was too easy to overlook it during high-speed hopping around the map).
* The ACOLYTE OF TRAGA may now be referred to as PRIEST or MONK.
* Eliminated conflicts with the noun SHADOW in the areas where there is a specific SHADOW noun to interact with.
* The player used to be able to bypass the no-dropping-stuff-here limitations (gullet, boudoir) by removing his own arm with a weapon held, since then the weapon dropped. The weapon no longer drops. Note that I'm fuzzy on when I actually made this change ... such is the way with long periods between the later releases, but it seems to have not been a problem in Release 7 either, so ... yeah. Okay? No problem is good.
* The DARK ALLEYWAY was missing a "the" all this time. Woo.
* Player can no longer get himself tossed in the sea-monster's gullet without the tools necessary to free himself (the PYREXIAN EYE and the VIRAXIAN INCENSE).
* The DEIFIC RAZOR is now cageworthy, with a specific FARADAY CAGE attack response.
* USE WEAPON ON FOE commands are now given a little extra help to understand that ASSAIL is the correct command (for people who didn't read the docs, didn't read the HELP, and presumably won't read the new line either, but oh well).
* Further adjusted the USE failures list so that USE WEAPON ON FOE works in the Gladiator Pit (tweaked the chummy foe response).
* The pronoun "HIM" is now force-replaced with "MAN" at the parser's door, a kludge for a problem I don't understand.

RELEASE 7 (Freeware Release) CHANGES

* Finally engaged with Glulx, which was a whole raft of workload. To keep everything working and looking simiolar, I had to fiddle with the COLOR command, the status line, the opening banner presentation, and then make a large number of changes throughout the code to line breaks that followed screen clearings, because Glulx treats the game's double-sized status line differently from the z-macine (requiring fewer inserted breaks to properly space between the status line and the game text). On the fun side, I added a big chunky MENU command with all kinds of documentation goodies and extras, and a kind of "best of" library of the best cheating and testing commands from the history of the game's development (and some new ones, used to test this release).
* Proper Copyright symbol finally, gingerly, put back in the code (I'd been avoiding it, ironically, because it used to cause a Glulx compile to crash, but now I7 is more up to speed on the unicode stuff).
* The Master Gladiator (and the MGREPOSE) may now be referred to as "cyaborg" or "limb trader" or "mutant." Now using "mazglad" token thing to streamline (I hope) between the two.
* The GET OFF command has been blocked (preventing default Inform responses to a command like GET OFF THE GLADIUS).
* The HIT POINTS command removed, subsumed into PROWESS.
* The HORATIO cheat changed to multiples of 5 points and otherwise fiddled a bit.
* "Implemented" (redirected) all the undone nouns in the Peak of Mount Gelidus, either to trivia or existing scenery (mists, farms, forests, pebbles).
* Adjusted Gunwar's healing powers again (up and down it goes).
* Gunwar healing report now accounts for single-hit-point heals (for when that's all the damage there is left to repair, mainly, but also for PERHAPSHALF cheating).
* "Oh, wait. There it is." Now ends that particular generic-description joke.
* Assorted other writing tweaks, including two changes to the rubbing-gina-with-unguent responses, removal of the "specific expression of distaste" line, and a change to the refusal when leaving the Succubus Bee Girl Witch Queen fight.
* Refined the ganking of the Succubus Bee Girl Witch Queen encounter introduced in R6 with a near-total overhaul of her stats and situation ... her Hit Points and damage are now based on the barbarian's current weapon and Hit Points, respectively, and the odds of the bewitchment effect are now based on the barbarian's current health instead of a simple coin-toss.
* Removed the ATMOB variable entirely; it had become redundant.
* Permanently yanked out (green-bracketed) the sample-version code, freeing up a little space to make sure the freeware has a good cheat library.
* Added "lice" to the synonyms for the PC on the obscure chance the player tries something after REGARD DOOR in the alleyway.
* Finally implemented the "diagonal blockers" to make the game pretend it has no idea (for example) what Northeast is. Removed some now-redundant sword-blockery on the part of the Lizard Maiden.
* PROWESS now explicitly notes the CYABORG ARM when it's attached.

RELEASE 6 CHANGES:

* Ganked the Succubus Bee Girl Witch Queen's damage to make the fight nigh unloseable.
* "Including yours." added to the THRAZAR response.
* Changed "ALL NIGHT eating her!" to "ALL NIGHT EATING HER!"
* Changed the second "lovely" in the Wraith's last speech to "wet."
* HELP amended to specify PARLEY WITH instead of just PARLEY.
* Inconsequential changes (removing uneccesary variables) to the Sampler Version code.
* Added "stone" to the synonyms for the castle gate.
* Put some ROCKS in the CRYPT
* Added "structure" to wall/floor stuff.
* Added "crack" to the synonyms for the INKY SLUICE.
* Added "stars" to trivia.
* Added "horizion" to sky synonyms.
* Added "bosom/bosoms" as GINA synonyms, removed redundant blushing-all-over joke (left the one in the final battle, removed the one from the ointment scenes).
* Added "brama worm" to citizen synonyms (already had "giant brama worm" and individual words, but not "brama worm").
* Got well rid of the "nouns" command.
* Had the parser notice the SIGN after killing the castle guard (by bracketing [sign]).
* Removed extraneous quotation mark in "Dragon of Wisdom" Gunwar chatter.
* Gunwar's death by Slaver King no longer mentions stairs (since it can happen if the player - however unlikely - chooses to un-wield Gunwar during battle). It also auto-Horks the Slaver King, now (usually redundant, but still).
* Replaced the non-adjacent room-looking response with a generic-error.
* Updated story copyright string and fixed reference to it for VERSION response.

RELEASE 5 CHANGES:

* Vanity fixes (applying to transcripts only) removing cruft from the Psi-Witch transaction ("Done.") and boarding the Pirate Ship (redundant room description).
* Some synonym spiffs inspired by the Jimmy Maher transcript ("eye patch" and "eye-patch" for the eyepatch, "space rag" for the space-rag), and my own fiddlings ("docks" for the Bustling Port).
* Added missing quotation mark in Thrang's graveyard scene.
* From Adam Thornton: apostrophe error fixed re Ruin Slug, added a generic Foe description (in response to a Solid Gold Spider descrip from his final transcript) and restored "L" functionality for REGARD.
* Graveyard "Down" responsed widened to include Lonely Hill (ironic since it already SAID that ...)
* Empty-line response of "Hm?" when arriving in Secret Lair of Science.
* Both Limbs added to the Table of Bear Chow
* "You friend the Robodroid arrives" corrected with "Your."
* Gunwar now has combat-specific arrival report.
* "WholeAgain" now waits 'til FoeFum isn't around.

RELEASE 4 CHANGES:

* The "WholeAgain" scene (Score 454 milestone) blocked once the Throne Room is visited.
* Xakanda doesn't mention the "delicate friend" unless DoxyProgress is 2 or more.
* The Cave Ooze attack is no longer scene-dependent (to fix random 1-turn delay).
* The REPOSE report altered slightly to allow for FoeFum contempt when uninjured.
* Added descriptions to the VIRAXIAN HELL-SOLDIER, SPECTERAL SPIRIT, PYREXIS HOUND PACK and VOLTAIC WRAITH.
* A few more miscellaneous/rare library messages replaced with generic errors.
* Added customized (and randomized) UNDO report.

RELEASE 3 CHANGES:

* No longer possible to trigger a dual-foe fight at the ice bridge. Probably.
* Status Bar reads "Paths:" instead of "Exits:" when in the Outdoors.
* Gunwar will now make his "keen observation" even when moving or if he shows up late.
* Status Bar functionally internally streamlined; EXITS command removed entirely.
* Hobling will no longer deliver alleyway schpiel when a foe is present.
* Pre-Hobling, can't enter Boudoir if Pyrexis Hounds or Voltaic Wraith is present
* Fiddled with timing of Pyrexian Hunt to unglue it a bit from Maiden's Demise.
* UNDO restrictions removed entirely; replaced with a quiet lock on combat randomness.
* Changes to extensions are now in the source (5T18 feature).
* DOWN now gets a response in the GRAVEYARD.
* Improved indefinite articles for STINKY BAIT and ANOINTING OIL.
* "UP" exit now explicit once the cord is tuggered.
* "DROP ON/IN" responses (introduced in R2!) now correctly chelated to generic-errors.
* "QUADROPHASIC" now spelled correctly, or as correctly as it gets.
* TEMPLE additions: GUNWAR scene, late-in-game PARLEY changes, "USE OINTMENT ON GINA," and "USE FLESH-TOTEM WITH ACOLYTE."
* Specific response to using FLASHLIGHT on both the WELL and the CULVERT.
* Improved response to TRIVIA.
* Slight change to MORGOM scene to fix new line-break issue in I7-5T18.
* Slight change to zapping-the-pool math to fix new math issue in I7-5T18.
* At end-game, name of room is now "LOFTY PROMONTORY" instead of "THRONE ROOM."
* New/promised "THRAZAR" command instantly "wins" the game.

RELEASE 2 CHANGES:

 * New SNOW-SERPENT MEAT clue from Gunwar, when you TABULATE.
 * Attempting to SEIZE GUNWAR now parses as an attempt to USE GUNWAR.
 * The LIZARD MAIDEN now does the stops-you-with-the-flat-of-her-blade thing correctly.
 * Better reponses to USE WITH command involving the barbarian directly.
 * Better synonym support for the SCHOOL of SKY-PIRANHA.
 * More alternate directions accepted (OUT from the Gladiator Pit, for example ... many others)
 * The WOODED FOOTHILLS are now "tether-limited," fixing a bug that let the cable stretch all the way to Mount Gelidus! (and into the cave and down the sluice and back up again ...)
 * POUCH OF RUNE-STONES removed from game.
 * TRIVIA (thritama larvae, ruffleback rabbits, etc) implemented for the first time in a post-testing release.
 * Better support for interacting with the SEA from a distance.

 * You can now SEIZE a comma-list of things, as per TAKE.
 * The IDOL now shuts up after the FLESH-TOTEM has been used there.
 * Tweaks to the damage within the GULLET (even slower if you've got the goods), and incense burns a turn faster.
 * Generic "dropped" and "taken" reports replaced by "discarded" and "seized" equivalents.
 * ... plus assorted minor tweaks improving synonyms, expanding the library of amusing responses to otherwise non-productive activities (like using sex tokens with Gina), and so on...

NOTE: Between Releases 2 and 3, I removed approximately 3,000 words of bracketed code and commentary to make the source a bit easier for me to navigate when doing maintenance and bugfixes. Some material had already been removed between Release 1 and 2, and between the Alpha/Beta versions and Release 1 ... refer to earlier archived code-sources if I ever go Glulx ... there are probably things I'd want to bring back, along with a handful of minor subplots, clues, easter-eggs and notions that I never had the time or space to implement at all ... ]

Chapter of Miscellany

[Early GUNWAR-ing: In WIMP mode at least, I can get on board the PIRATE SHIP, holding the BLACK HOLE METAL AXE, at a Score of exactly 100 points (when I've boarded), and then 123 points post-MORGOM ...].

[Man of Peace: I can get 63 points without attacking anything (this requires annoying each gladiator with the Flashlight ...) and Adam Thornton did 67]

[Man of Cherry Wine: I can get 225 points without having sex with Vessa ... In theory, 228 points should be possible if not probable (requires defeating the Master Gladiator a third time, maybe by saving the meat for it, but I used it to defeat him the SECOND time in my testing run, so ...)]

[32767 seems to be the highest "experience point" value the game will recognize]

[the proper spellings (because I'm terrible with vowel combos) WIELD, SEIZE, GUARD]

[… should be ... Kill every ellipsis (except this one, which is handy for search-and-replace)]

[The [KILLFIRST] tag indicates something that can be scrapped easily if I need more space]

      change HP of the Player to HP of the Player / WIMPB;

Apprenticizing is an action applying to nothing. Understand "Apprentice" as Apprenticizing.

Carry out apprenticizing:
   if CourVariable is 1 begin;
      say "You have locked this game in COURAGE mode, preventing access to that command." instead;
      end if;
   if WimpVar is 1 begin;
      say "You are already in APPRENTICE combat-difficulty mode." instead;
      end if;
   Change WimpVar to 1; Change WIMPT to 4; Change WIMPB to 3;
   Say "Battle difficulty switched to APPRENTICE mode (barbarian Hit Points above-average).";
      change HP of the Player to HP of the Player * WIMPT;
      change HP of the Player to HP of the Player / WIMPB;

Wimping is an action applying to nothing. Understand "Wimp" or "Whimp" as wimping.

Carry out Wimping:
   if CourVariable is 1 begin;
      say "You have locked this game in COURAGE mode, preventing access to that command." instead;
      end if;
   if WimpVar is 2 begin;
      say "You are already in WIMP combat-difficulty mode." instead;
      end if;
   Change WimpVar to 2; Change WIMPT to 8; Change WIMPB to 3; [--- near limit see below]
   Say "Battle difficulty switched to WIMP mode (barbarian Hit Points boosted, verily)!";
      change HP of the Player to HP of the Player * WIMPT;
      change HP of the Player to HP of the Player / WIMPB;

[Due to the oddball fractions required to get the Amulet of Science and Impervium Plate Mail truly and scientifically realistic, the combination of those two will crash the game if the player's core hit points go too high ... Not a problem in Official or Apprentice mode, but it defines the practical limits of Wimp mode, or more specifically of the WIMPT variable]
  
Volume of DOCUMENTED SECONDARY ACTIONS

Book of the WAIT Command

Understand "Rest" and "Repose" as waiting.

Book of the INVENTORY Command

Understand "TABULATE" or "TAB" or "T" as taking inventory.

Instead of taking inventory: Say "[if the number of things enclosed by the player is 0]You carry only your trusty THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG.[end if][if the number of things enclosed by the player is 1]You carry only [SCHTUFF], and your trusty THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG.[end if][if the number of things enclosed by the player is greater than 1]You bear the following (both on your person and stashed in your trusty THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG): [SCHTUFF].[SlabClue][end if]"

To say SCHTUFF:
   list the contents of the player, as a sentence.

SLBCL is a number variable. SLBCL is 0.

To say SlabClue:
   if Gunwar is touchable and the player encloses the SLAB and SLBCL is 0, say "[line break][quotation mark]Har,[quotation mark] says GUNWAR, sniffing the air wafting from your DUFFEL. [quotation mark]I smells a SLAB OF SNOW-SERPENT MEAT! That[']s tricky stuff, lad ...

   if Gunwar is touchable and the player encloses the SLAB and SLBCL is 0 begin;
      now SLBCL is 1;
      end if;

Chapter of the THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG

The THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG is a backdrop. It is everywhere. Understand "sack/trusty/canvas/duffle" as the THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG. The description of the THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG is "The DUFFEL BAG is crafted of sturdy THESKIAN CANVAS. It bears the stains, smells, and wear of many years of broody, restless barbarian travel."

Before taking inventory when the number of things enclosed by the player is 0: have the parser notice the THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG.

Before doing anything except examining or attacking or dropping or taking or conversing with to the THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG, say "The THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG is practically an extension of you; you've carried it since you were an infant, and it does its job without commands." instead;

Before dropping the THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG, say "You've carried the THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG since you were an infant! It is integral to your life, your well-being, and your smell." instead;

Before taking the THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG, say "It is here by your side, as always." instead;

Before attacking the THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG, say "During many points in your life, the THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG has been your only friend, confidante, and bed-partner. Save your mindless rages for the SLAVER KING, barbarian. Don't hurt the ones you love." instead;

Before conversing with the THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG when Antwerp has happened, say "You while away the hours, chatting with your THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG. Because you're kind of a lunatic, aren't you?" instead;

Book of Namegoing (Adapted from Examples)

Namegoing is an action applying to one thing.

Understand "[room]" as namegoing. Understand "go to/into/inside/aboard/in/on [room]" or "go [room]" or "enter [room]" or "visit [room]" [or "board [room]" ]or "use [room]" as namegoing. 

Understand "go into/inside/in/to [thingy thing]" or "go [thingy thing]" or "enter [thingy thing]" as entering.

After deciding the scope of the player when namegoing:
        repeat with loc running through rooms begin;
                place loc in scope, but not its contents;
        end repeat.

Check namegoing:
   if the noun is the location, say "[The location] is thy current environment, barbarian. Didst thou mean something other?" instead;
   if the noun is not adjacent, say "The way there is nowhere near, barbarian." instead;

Carry out namegoing:
   let aim be the best route from the location to the noun, using doors;
   if aim is not a direction, say "[generic-error]" instead;
   try going aim;

Book of How We Used To Fill The Empty Spaces

[This Book became necessary when preparing the Glulx version, which, as it turns out, required HUGE numbers of exceptions to deal with the two-line status bar, which the z-machine (or at least, most z-machine interpreters?) treats very differently in terms of putting space between it and the game text.

A pleasant irony, though: replacing all those chunks of similar code with variables ended up buying me a kilobyte or more of free space in the main (Z-Machine) version of the game, allowing me to slip in a few extra goodies for the freeware release. So, a pain in the ass, but also a lesson learned in more efficient and flexible I7 programming ...]

Book of the OPEN PLAIN

The OPEN PLAIN is a room. "A gentle breeze ripples the sparse grasses here, under a blood-red sun. There are many paths. You see mountains to the distant east. You feel a manly twitching in your thews, enlivened by the freedom of the open country." The player is in the OPEN PLAIN.

The GLADIUS SWORD is here. The GLADIUS SWORD is a weapon with LoDam 2, HiDam 7.

Book of the Farmer's Green

The FARMER'S GREEN is west of the OPEN PLAIN. "A humble WELL provides a centerpiece for this quiet place, surrounded by farmland providing food for the port town to the west. To the north, the shadow of the SLAVER KING'S CASTLE blots out part of the evening sky, but there's no path there from here."

An EAR OF CORN is here. It is kinky. A WELL is here. It is scenery.

Book of the IDOL SWAMP

The IDOL SWAMP is east of the OPEN PLAIN. "You stand in a dismal swamp, with the chitter of unpleasant life in every direction. Footing is torturous here, slowed by the grey murk sucking at your sandaled tread."

Chapter of the Mossy Stone Idol

A MOSSY STONE IDOL is in the IDOL SWAMP. "There is a large, MOSSY STONE IDOL here. Even half-sunken in the mire, it stands a head taller than you, with crude, angry features.". The description of the mossy stone idol is "The features of the IDOL glare with stony, furious contempt, as if [italic type]daring[roman type] you to USE it." Understand "statue/moss" as the mossy stone idol.

Instead of taking the mossy stone idol, say "The MOSSY STONE IDOL is vast and you are but mortal."

   if demon summoning has happened, say "The MOSSY STONE IDOL mocks you with ancient silence." instead;
   say "THE SKY RINGS WITH LAUGHTER!!! You are mocked by the Viraxian Gods for attempting to make USE of their idol unprepared. A voice rings out: 'Bring the proper tribute ... USE it with the IDOL,' it says, 'and we MAY choose to reward you.'" instead.

Section of The VIRAXIAN HELL-SOLDIER Summoning Scene

The BLACK HOLE METAL AXE is a cageworthy weapon with LoDam 3 and HiDam 30. The description is "The haft is made of a reddish iron with an alien-leather grip. The blade is almost utterly black and heavier than anything should be at that size. It hums, faintly, with a distant demonic hell-song.

Book of the DARK ALLEYWAY

The DARK ALLEYWAY is south of the BUSTLING PORT. "Places like this wretched ALLEYWAY make you yearn for the clean air and freedom of the open country. Buildings lean against one another, far above your head[if the RATS are touchable], and RATS scurry around the base of a large BARREL[otherwise]. There is a large BARREL here, presently devoid of scurrying RATS[end if]. To the north lay the bustling quayside. To the south, you could easily scramble over the city wall and up a brambly hill."

Before going UP when the location of the player is the DARK ALLEYWAY: try GOING SOUTH instead;

Some RATS are here. RATS are animals. "Light shines from a half-open doorway nearby, you could go IN if you wanted. The air from the doorway smells of subtle perfumes and spices." Understand "rat" as some rats. The rats are ambiguously plural. The description of the rats is "They scurry and scuttle and they have beady little eyes. As you REGARD them, it almost seems that they pause to REGARD you in return."

A BARREL is here. The BARREL is scenery. The description of the barrel is "The BARREL is a sturdy thing, filled with rainwater and foul city-dweller trash.". Before taking or using the barrel, say "Even if you were to empty the BARREL of rainwater and trash, it's of no use that you can tell." instead. Understand "cask/keg/rundle/barrell" or  "garbage/refuse/rubbish/rainwater/water/trash" as the barrel.

A HALF-OPEN DOORWAY is a backdrop. A HALF-OPEN DOORWAY is in the DARK ALLEYWAY and the PERFUMED BOUDOIR. The description is "[if the player is in the perfumed boudoir]It's half-open, since the DOXY is not (at the moment) engaged in the rigors of her trade.[otherwise]It's half-open, and the scent of the air is inviting. There is a scent beyond perfume and spice, too ... a feminine musk which stirs something in your loins, something more primal than the lice.[end if]". Before entering the HALF-OPEN DOORWAY when the player is in the DARK ALLEYWAY, try going inside instead. Before using the HALF-OPEN DOORWAY when the player is in the DARK ALLEYWAY, try going inside instead. Before entering the DOORWAY when the player is in the BOUDOIR, try going outside instead. Before using the DOORWAY when the player is in the BOUDOIR, try going outside instead. Understand "door/half/open/portal" and "half open" as the HALF-OPEN DOORWAY.

The PERFUMED BOUDOIR is inside from the Dark Alleyway. "You find yourself in a soft maze of colored veils, leading to a large bed piled with furs and cloth pillows.

Understand "hooker/whore/prostitute/doxie" as the DOXY. The description of the DOXY is "True to her reputation, VESSA is almost too delicate for a neighborhood so rough as the DARK ALLEYWAY outside. Despite her small size and tempting curves, however, your keen Warrior's awareness detects an inner ferocity, and her eyes are bright with intellect, cunning ... even wickedness.

Before, I had it as "before going," which meant the more specific second rule always dominated, even once the player was surrounded]

Check using something with the anointing oil:

Before taking GINA: say "GINA smiles at your gallant attempt to haul her away to be your barbaric plaything. 'Wouldst that my fate be different, barbarian! I find you pleasing, but this sacrifice is my destiny, and I wish it for the fate of my people.' She squirms flirtatiously." instead;

Check Conversing with GINA THE VIRGIN SACRIFICE:
   say "[if the Score is greater than 300]GINA smiles a sly smile. 'We have heard, Barbarian, of your great quest ... and perhaps,' she says, her voice lowered to a sultry whisper 'when the time comes, we here at the TEMPLE may aid you in it.' She wriggles pleasantly, and you see that the ACOLYTE OF TRAGA is grinning slightly, and nodding to himself.[otherwise]GINA notices the look of concern in your eyes. 'Worry not, barbarian, for I am here by choice. My life-force will be an UNHOLY GIFT to the VIRAXIAN DEMON-GODS, and spare my people a poor harvest.' She continues with more along those lines, but you find yourself distracted by her naked body, gleaming with ANOINTING OIL. You do your best to keep your eyes level and pay attention." instead;

Check attacking GINA THE VIRGIN SACRIFICE:
  say "The ACOLYTE OF TRAGA chuckles. 'I'll be killing her later on, as our DARK LORDS demand. Patience, barbarian.'" instead;

   if the acolyte does not carry the SECRETS OF STATE, say "The ACOLYTE OF TRAGA shakes his head gently. 'The incense is sacred to our faith, barbarian. I would never give it up cheaply ... I would only trade the INCENSE for something of real value in advancing my ambitions, something I could hang over the heads of those foolish lords who serve the SLAVER KING.'" instead;

   if the acolyte carries the FIERY JEWEL, say "The ACOLYTE nods in greeting. 'It is comforting to have a Warrior visit us here. We worry constantly of invasion by the BEE GIRLS and THREE-HEADED GIANTS of the high mountains, and perhaps a man like you can aid me ...' He holds up a beautiful gem. 'Bring me a worthy WEAPON I can use to defend the TEMPLE, and I will give you this valuable FIERY JEWEL.' The treasure he offers is indeed beautiful: a darkly-shining stone with living sparks inside.[line break]" instead;

Check using it with:
   if the noun is the DELICATELY-OILED CLOTH and the second noun is gina, say "GINA smiles at your touch. 'It is unfortunate, barbarian, that my fate is to be sacrificed for the good of my village. I would have liked to linger with you in a less holy setting ...' She sighs." instead;

Check using it with:

   say "In a moment when the ACOLYTE is looking elsewhere, you wipe the soft ABSORBENT SPACE-RAG across GINA's naked, heaving bosoms, lingering no longer than you dare. GINA grins at the secret moment you have shared, and now you have a DELICATELY-OILED CLOTH.";

Book of the Oceanic Gullet

The SEA-MONSTER'S GULLET is a room. "The floor is the squishy flesh of a monstrous gullet. The walls are the squishy flesh of a monstrous gullet. The ceiling is the squishy flesh of a monstrous gullet ... and the DIGESTIVE JUICES are rising to consume you." The SEA-MONSTER'S GULLET is up from the SEA-MONSTER'S GULLET. The SEA-MONSTER'S GULLET is down from the SEA-MONSTER'S GULLET.

Some DIGESTIVE JUICES are scenery in the SEA-MONSTER'S GULLET. The description is "The rising flood of DIGESTIVE JUICES is sort of orange, sort of green, and very fizzy.

Before entering some digestive juices: say "The real trick, barbarian, will be getting OUT of the DIGESTIVE JUICES." instead;

On the HALF-DIGESTED CORPSE is the EYEPATCH OF ODIN and the FLESH-TOTEM OF DARTH VIRAXIS. The indefinite article of the eyepatch is "the". Understand "patch" or "eye patch" or "eye-patch" as the eyepatch. Understand "flesh/totem/fetish/doll" as the Flesh-Totem of Darth Viraxis. The Flesh-Totem is gross.
   The description of the eyepatch is "You can tell it's authentically the EYEPATCH OF ODIN because there is a tag, in the old runes: 'PROPERTY OF ODIN ALL-FATHER. RETURNEST IFFETH FOUND.'".
   The description of the flesh-totem is "You've heard of these blasphemous items ... warped dolls fashioned from the real flesh of the powerful, used to appease dark godlings and great demons. This one bears a remarkable resemblance to DARTH VIRAXIS of the VIRAXIAN EMPIRE.".

[RuneEgg is a scene. RuneEgg begins when the HP of the Player is 100. RuneEgg ends when RuneEgg begins. [KillFirst]

When RuneEgg begins:
   Move the POUCH OF RUNE-STONES to a random zappified room.

A POUCH OF RUNE-STONES is a thing. "Someone has dropped a POUCH here." It is ambiguously plural. It is unremotable. Understand "runes/runestones/8-ball/stones" or "magic 8-ball" as the POUCH OF RUNE-STONES. The  description is "Sa-Ho! The stones in this pouch are carv-ed with ancient RUNES of magic! You know of these great oracles, and how to use them: when thou needst guidance, travel to the site of thine quandary, then USE the RUNE-STONES to know the hidden truths of present and future, do or fail, yes or no."

Check using the POUCH OF RUNE-STONES:
   say "[one of]The runes sayeth[or]The runes, in their wisdom, doth say[or]The ancient stones sayeth[or]The elder glyphs do say unto you[in random order]: [italic type][quotation mark][one of]Signs point to yes[or]Yes[or]Most likely[or]Without a doubt[or]Yes - definitely[or]As I see it, yes[or]You may rely on it[or]Outlook good[or]It is certain[or]It is decidedly so[or]Reply hazy, try again[or]Better not tell you now[or]Ask again later[or]Concentrate and ask again[or]Cannot predict now[or]My sources say no[or]Very doubtful[or]My reply is no[or]Outlook not so good[or]Don't count on it[at random].[quotation mark][roman type][line break]" instead;]

"[quotation mark]... And she went on to demonstrate that she could SEDUCE anyone, regardless of species. It was the most interesting bet I ever lost, even if it cost me more than 800 GOLD CREDITS.[quotation mark]"
"[quotation mark]... And then there was the time,[quotation mark] says GUNWAR, [quotation mark]when I had to fight sixteen more of [']em in the CITY OF THUNDERS.[quotation mark]"
"[quotation mark]... But if you want something REALLY savory, really special, sample some freshly-slaughtered CAVE OOZE sometime. Lick the leavings right off your [ReadyWeapon], lad! I[']m not sure why their high level of Edibility isn[']t more recognized among delvers.[quotation mark]"

"[quotation mark]Leadership, me bucko. Never let anyone tell you different. It[']s all about Leadership. And Damnation Vans. And grog, lots of grog. But mainly Leadership.[quotation mark]"
"[quotation mark]Oh, the HIDDEN CAVES are no myth,[quotation mark] says GUNWAR. [quotation mark]People just say that to keep [']em to themselves. But they go on for miles, and there[']s still lots of good treasure there, if you don[']t mind a BLINK BEAST attack every second watch. Either way, you[']ll grow plenty sick of BLINK BEAST JERKY without an edible-excreter in the party to sauce things up a bit.[quotation mark]"
"[quotation mark]So I said to it, I said: If ye [I]truly[n] be a DRAGON OF WISDOM, then prove it! Right?[quotation mark] And this old DRAGON, it just lifted up one bloody great claw and [i]pointed[n] ... just pointed at the DRAGON sitting right next to [']im.[paragraph break]That gave me pause, lad.

"[quotation mark]The very worst kind of person to have in a delving party? An EVOLVED ELF, no question. The EVOLVED are snooty enough as it is, without also being ELVES. Traveled for a long time with an EVOLVED VULKIN, though, and never noticed the difference between her and a regular one. I suppose being only HALF Elven, it levels things out a bit.[quotation mark]"
"[quotation mark]There is an unspoken rule, lad: Never have more than two PLANETARY APES in the same party as a LIZARD MAN.[quotation mark]"
"[quotation mark]We had a Warlock who[']d complain every time we served up stewed RADIOACTOR, as if such a treat were less than His Mighty Warlockness deserved. I dined frequently on RADIOACTOR, my friend, and I can tell you, I[']ve very few unwanted mutations to show for it.[quotation mark]"
"[quotation mark]We used to do a lot of raiding up along the coast,[quotation mark] GUNWAR recalls, [quotation mark]but village-life was too sweet a trap. Many of our able-bodied ran off to be farmers ... one even took the TRAGA OATH, set up a TEMPLE in these parts. Nothing sadder, me lad, than a once-fine buccaneer gone pious![quotation mark]"

Chapter of FUTHARK

A POUCH OF RUNE-STONES is a thing. It is ambiguously plural. It is unremotable. Understand "runes/runestones/8-ball/stones" or "magic 8-ball" as the POUCH OF RUNE-STONES. The  description is "Sa-Ho! The stones in this pouch are carv-ed with ancient RUNES of magic! You know of these great oracles, and how to use them: when thou needst guidance, travel to the site of thine quandary, then USE the RUNE-STONES to know the hidden truths of present and future, do or fail, yes or no."

Check using the POUCH OF RUNE-STONES:
   say "[one of]The runes sayeth[or]The runes, in their wisdom, doth say[or]The ancient stones sayeth[or]The elder glyphs do say unto you[in random order]: [italic type][quotation mark][one of]Signs point to yes[or]Yes[or]Most likely[or]Without a doubt[or]Yes - definitely[or]As I see it, yes[or]You may rely on it[or]Outlook good[or]It is certain[or]It is decidedly so[or]Reply hazy, try again[or]Better not tell you now[or]Ask again later[or]Concentrate and ask again[or]Cannot predict now[or]My sources say no[or]Very doubtful[or]My reply is no[or]Outlook not so good[or]Don't count on it[at random].[quotation mark][roman type][line break]" instead;

   wait for any key;
   try menuing instead;][Briefly entertained fully adding the POUCH back to the game, but as a "portal" of sorts to the additional menus. Too precious; ditched it.]

Before using the POUCH OF RUNE-STONES with when the second noun is person and the second noun is not an animal and the second noun is not a foe and the second noun is not female and the second noun is not the robodroid, say "[The second noun] grins. [quotation mark]Those toy RUNES are fun; I used to have some when I was younger.[quotation mark][line break]" instead;

Chapter of CHEEZ

Cheezing is an action out of world. Understand "CHEEZ" as cheezing.

Here, among the dusty oddities, the main draw will probably be the online version of the [i]CryptoClues[n] hint set (you don[']t need to [quotation mark]decrypt[quotation mark] them at all, making them either incredibly convenient or dangerously easy, depending on your point of view).

I [i]have[n] included a flipping great pile of cheating, testing, and easter-egging commands (see [i]The Compleat Cheat[n], in the appropriate sub-menu), but I didn[']t really mess with the game itself, which remains exactly what I want it to be.";

Use a printout of the [i]CryptoClues,[n] and experience the game to the fullest. If you[']re a [i]Treasures[n] veteran re-visiting the game for a nostalgic grin: welcome.

Table of Ear of Corn Hints

Table of Gina the Virgin Sacrifice Hints
hint	used 
"She isn[']t naked and oily for puerile kicks. Well ... not [i]exclusively.[n]"	a number

Table of Gunwar Hints
hint	used 
"He[']s aboard the Pirate Ship, not hanging out with the other pirates."	a number
"Remember what Thrang said he was looking for?"
"Use the Black Hole Metal Axe with him. Gunwar has many uses: Parleying partner, healer, Faraday Cage smasher, even hand-held-weapon ... but if you can[']t USE him yet, it means there[']s something else you haven[']t done. Be patient, or refer to other sections."

Table of Inky Sluice Hints

Table of Length of Biphasic Cabling Hints
hint	used 
"Use it with the Robodroid, then the Phasic Sump, then the Robodroid again."	a number

Table of Lost Poems of Sutok Hints
hint	used

Table of My Own Arm Hints
hint	used

"Go do other stuff, and check back later on."

Table of Pirate Ship Hints
hint	used 
"The Pirates offer clues when you try going in."	a number
"You need to accessorize just like a pirate, but there aren't any parrots or rum to be found."

hint	used 
"He's got everything under control; don't worry."	a number
"Just take the Seventh Hoarfrost Diamond, as he suggests."

hint	used 
"The flame it makes is brief and small, like from a match."	a number
"Have you seen anything described as 'unlit?'"

"Like he says, you can get cabling where you've seen other Robodroids ..."
"Get the Biphasic Cabling from the Slave Pens, and use it with him, then the Phasic Sump, then with him again."

"For the final healing phase, lure the Voltaic Wraith to the Scarred Forest."

Table of Secrets of State Hints

"Vessa loves these things. Someday she'll be legendary for her uncanny kinship with diamonds."

Table of Slab of Snow-Serpent Meat Hints
hint	used 
"It isn't useful [']til it's rotted a bit. You'll smell it when it happens; it won't take long."	a number
"Timing is important, but don't hoard it forever. Use it for a tough foe, like the Ruin Slug, Solid Gold Spider, or Master Gladiator."
"Use it (preferably in combat) when your hit points are low. It heals you quickly, and also opens other pathways in  the game, in ways that won't immediately be apparent."

Table of Slaver King Hints
hint	used 
"Get the best armor you can, get the best weapon you can, make lots of friends."	a number
"You can face the Slaver King long before you're able to survive his wrath! Be wary."
"If you've scored four-hundred ninety points, that's the highest possible without entering the Throne Room, but you can defeat the Slaver King with less, as long as you're wearing the Amulet of Science. Without the Amulet, it would be almost impossible."

Table of Solid Gold Statue Hints
hint	used 
"She's too heavy to carry."	a number
"Nobody will help you haul her off."

"When you figure that out, be sure to SAVE before using the Bait."
"Use the Bait at the Seashore."

Table of Telephone Pole Hints
hint	used 
"If you've got a VERY strong arm, it's a powerful weapon! If you haven't, it's useless to you."	a number
"Has anything happened to your arm lately? If not, be patient."
"Once you've mutated and practiced your Limb-Trading with a friend, you'll be able to pick up (and wield) the Telephone Pole."

Table of Tiny Book Hints
hint	used 
"Most fish cannot read."	a number
"Maybe this one can. Have you parleyed with the Magic Fish? Don't dismiss the response if you do."
"The Magic Fish is [i]not[n] a Red Herring, but his Tiny Book is, if it exists at all (it does, but it'd take a couple of sequels to this game to find out why)."

Table of Triphasic Power Core Hints
hint	used 
"The Royal Psi-Witch should have told you what it's for."	a number
"Just carry it. It operates automatically, using Science and stuff."
"It allows you to seize the Amulet of Science."

Table of Vessa Hints
hint	used 
"Visit often. After each transaction, Parley again."	a number
"There are five treasures she'll accept as payment. For fun (and extra points) experiment with offering her just about anything! But the correct treasures are:"

Table of Viraxian Incense Hints
hint	used 
"You need a match or a lighter. But there are none."	a number
"What else makes a brief puff of flame?"
"Use the Pyrexian Eye with it."

Table of Wraith Hints
hint	used 
"Killing him with a hand-weapon is only temporary."	a number
"He's voltaic. Has anyone else used the word 'voltaic' when talking to you? If not, be patient and focus on other things. Let the Wraith be a nuisance for now."
"Lure him to the Scarred Forest when the Robodroid is almost completely repaired (able to chat, with the Blue End of the Cable attached to him)."

Table of Well Hints
hint	used 
"Ever hear of a Wishing Well?"	a number
"Sadly, they are illegal here, by decree of the Slaver King."
"It's a good reason to kill him. It's also a good reason to ignore the Well."

   say twobreak;
   say "Even in bogus alt-universe 1979, computer-game barbarians need to get more powerful as the game goes on ... but even in bogus alt-universe game designer Hank Riley[']s brain, it[']s nonsensical for a barbarian to climb from 1st to 10th level (or more) in a single long evening[']s adventure. So, the game[']s Score does [i]not[n] equate to [i]Encounter Critical[n] experience points (well, partially, but only in COURAGE mode and the equation is pretty goofy). Instead, the barbarian begins play as a Level 10 Warrior who has been beaten, both physically and emotionally, by the ordeal of slavery and must regain his rightful stature, restoring his body and his confidence from his weakened [quotation mark]first level[quotation mark] state. How? By solving simple puzzles and engaging in randomized battles, as the Creator (and his friend Jim Ireland) intended.";
   say line break;
   say "As of 450 points, the barbarian is well and truly His Old Self Again, and the game provides a message to that general effect. From there on in, he[']s feeling the bump to that next level he[']s been earning, and on that hangs (hopefully) a mighty victory against the SLAVER KING.

   say "Defeating each Gladiator multiple times also [quotation mark]trains them up[quotation mark] for the fight with the Slaver King.

   say twobreak;
   say "[f]We are leaping beyond even that with the aid of a fan and professional computer expert, one Dr. Saul Leeman of Detroit. A couple of years ago he began work on an epic computerized adventure, a role-play tale of an escaped barbarian seeking wealth and vengeance on his captor. I met with this fine gentleman at the Dungeon this winter and saw a demonstration of his work in progress (he was showing it to some editors who work on a certain very popular game of dragon-slaying and dungeon-exploring). Those editors didn[']t know genius when they saw it, but I did, and Dr. Leeman was delighted to discuss matters with me further. We agreed: his computer-adventure belongs in one of the Slaver Kingdoms of Vanth! And thus, the first Encounter Critical computer game is already close to release. Right now, the good doctor is adjusting the content of his game according to my instructions to make it 100% faithful to the world of Vanth, and very true to the spirit and accuracy of the EC rules.[n]";

   say "[f]The game, titled [quotation mark]Treasures of a Slaver[']s Kingdom,[quotation mark] will be available later this year, possibly even in time for Gen Con. See the next issue for an advertisement and ordering instructions, and until then, be excited! This game is an amazing creation that truly allows you to enter Vanth and adventure there, in an environment of absolute fairness adjudicated by the logic of computer science. The game is played in perfectly natural English sentences, like [quotation mark]Take eyepatch[quotation mark] or even complex constructions like [quotation mark]Use garter on doxy![quotation mark] And speaking of logic: get your mind sharp, because there are mysteries to be solved before the Slaver King will kneel before you, barbarian![n]";

   say "Of course, history tells us that the game was never published. It was, I believed, lost forever ... perhaps never really finished at all. However, the revival of [i]Encounter Critical[n] here at Cumberland and on this list has attracted some attention from unusual quarters, and I[']ve recently been contacted by the family of the late Doctor (indeed, Professor) Leeman, who provided me with a complete printout of the game[']s source code. A fairly modest stack of paper, I must say - alarming how really simple these old adventure games were on the inside. Accompanying the source (which seems to be close to final in terms of overall design and adherence to Vanthian mythologies) are several notes, including (perhaps predictably) increasingly angry and frustrated correspondence between Hank and the Professor. They even had an arrangement with a small Detroit publisher to get the game on shelves for the TRS-80 and Apple II systems, but personal differences ground the agreements to a halt. The stack also includes mock-up versions of the original documentation, and a map by James Ireland meant to provide a model for the software publisher[']s own artists.";
   say line break;
   say "With the aid of the source and the notes (and the correspondence) I[']ve begun the process of adapting this game into a z-code format playable on modern computers, using Inform 7. It[']s a challenge, mostly because I[']m having to learn how to dumb down Inform 7 to match the limitations of the original 1979 game. I[']m doing my best to re-create the game as precisely as I can manage, with few alterations apart from a few tweaks to address some of Hank[']s concerns about proper adherence to Vanth. I[']ll also be adding an online help menu to supplement the PDF docs.";
   say line break;
   say "And Hank was right. I[']m excited. The writing is pretty terrible and the [quotation mark]English[quotation mark] you can use is crude (sub-[i]Zork[n]). The puzzles aren[']t all that hard for the most part, but there[']s monster-hacking and (sure enough) a doxy that wants a garter and who[']ll reward you handsomely for it ... There[']s a wrecked spaceship and phasic energies and quite a lot of bloodletting. It[']s very [i]EC,[n] in its way: almost painfully humble, yet sure of itself. I like it already, and I think you will too.";

   say "Like the Gazettes, this will be a limited-time commercial offering with an automatic release to freeware thereafter. The delay between commercial release and freeware release will be a bit longer (probably 24 months) but the principle[']s the same: This game will ultimately be 100% free, no take-backsies, with the choice to support the project being an early-adopter[']s option.

Chapter of the Secret History

To say GameHistory:
   say line break;
   say "It wasn[apostrophe]t until 1988 that CogniKing co-founder Saul Leeman confessed that the CogniKing empire (at the time, more than 60 best-selling adventure-game titles available in 22 languages) had been constructed on an [i]invisible[n] foundation.";
   say line break;
   say "By that time, the [i]Encounter Critical[n] pen-and-paper game had seen its heyday come and go, and CogniKing was still enjoying what would be the last of its own global fame. So I suppose it was harmless by then to admit that the blockbuster [i]Grace[apostrophe]s Galaxy[n] trilogy - known to text-gamers, moviegoers and Broadway-musical fans alike - had not, in fact, been Leeman[apostrophe]s first design. Instead, the founding game - never published and never mentioned, but echoing throughout the CogniKing line - had been an [i]Encounter Critical[n] tie-in, a science-fantasy work shelved due to behind-the-scenes friction between those involved.";
   say line break;
   say "At the time of the interview, CogniKing fans were still being treated to several new releases a year, including best-sellers like [i]Thunder Gulch IV, The Alcatraz Invasion[n] and [i]Sadie and Wonko[apostrophe]s Thumpin[apostrophe] Good Barbecue.[n] Even the controversial [i]Ennui![n] trilogy was out-selling non-CogniKing titles by a healthy margin, and the future, as they say, looked bright. Consequently, the news made barely a ripple on the text-adventure pond. It was a footnote, nothing more.";
   say line break;
   say "In the [i]Encounter Critical[n] camp, reactions were stronger. At UnheroiCon, there was a kind of stunned confusion, as every fan faced the same question: [i]How was it possible that there had once been an [n][b]Encounter Critical[n][i] adventure game, by [n]CogniKing[i] no less, and Hank Riley never told a soul outside the Battle Star Games circle?[n] Hank Riley never addressed the matter in public, and after a time, [i]Treasures of a Slaver[apostrophe]s Kingdom[n] faded into the realm of half-forgotten trivia, even among [i]E.C.[n] fans.";
   say line break;
   say "Nearly 20 years have passed since those revelations, and a few of those involved (including [quotation mark]Professor[quotation mark] Leeman and Hank Riley[apostrophe]s creative partner, Jim Ireland) are no longer with us. Hank[apostrophe]s wife and sometimes-writing-partner Dinah divorced him some time ago. CogniKing, once the most powerful entertainment-software publisher in the world, has been shuttered for years, and Battle Star Games likewise.";
   say line break;
   say "So it was - to say the least - unexpected when the Leeman family approached me last year with two boxes, overflowing with everything that remains of [i]Slaver[apostrophe]s Kingdom,[n] and a freshly-signed letter of goodwill from Hank Riley, and another from Dinah. As the carrier of the [i]Encounter Critical[n] torch, a curious task had fallen on my shoulders.";
   say line break;
   say "It took me months to sift through and catalogue the contents of the boxes. Nearly half of the material was fragmentary, in the form of correspondence between Hank Riley & [quotation mark]Professor[quotation mark] Leeman. The earliest of these letters included scenes and notions for the game ... the later ones were mostly bitter arguments over features, rules interpretations, and the game[apostrophe]s scope. It became obvious that the game had existed prior to the [i]Encounter Critical[n] arrangement, as a more generic fantasy work by Leeman alone, so some of the friction arose from how best to marry the original ideas to the new setting. New tremors rattled the foundations when Dinah - who remains an aspiring fantasy novelist to this day - inserted herself into the project, adding a third authorial voice to an already-confused narrative, and making Leeman feel (perhaps justly) teamed-upon.";
   say line break;
   say "But amid the rapidly-declining friendship between Leeman and the Rileys, a game emerged, bound by a common thread of enthusiasm for high-adventure science fantasy of the [i]Encounter Critical[n] stripe. In later years, Leeman[apostrophe]s winning blend of basically-pointless random fights and disjointed, paper-thin plots would be the toast of the globe, but here, in these boxes, I could see it being born. This was the invisible foundation for the CogniKing style, a style still imitated by modern game writers, still studied by those keen to make their mark on the medium.";
   say line break;
   say "If you[apostrophe]ve played a lot of CogniKing titles, you[apostrophe]ve likely played some fragments of this game already. The Venusian-oil-gathering puzzle from [i]GGII: Darkest Star[n] is here in its original context, for example, and can the similarities between this game[apostrophe]s [quotation mark]Secret Lair of Science[quotation mark] sequence and the [quotation mark]Secret Lair of Knowledge[quotation mark] from [i]The Volcano God Murders[n] be coincidence? Both have a professor with exactly the same name.";
   say line break;
   say "Before we get into what exists of the game[apostrophe]s original documentation, some final notes on the [quotation mark]accuracy[quotation mark] of this adaptation: Since no definitive version of [i]ToaSK[n] was ever released from CogniKing or Battle Star, it would be wrong to say that this Cumberland title is a [quotation mark]faithful[quotation mark] port. In most cases, I had more than a half-dozen versions of each sequence and location to choose from, and in a few cases, where the original game was left unfinished and only partly-discussed, I had to provide some new bridging material of my own, extrapolating from the design notes (and arguments) that remain. I have done my best to keep these additions minimal and seamless. The voices of Hank Riley, Dinah Riley, and Saul Leeman are all represented in this version, incompatible as ever. Similarly, the quiet hand of Jim Ireland has touched every part of the game, even though he wasn[apostrophe]t formally a part of the original contract. Working from the most complete printouts of the source code, I have done my best to preserve even the game[apostrophe]s most egregious quirks. The writing is often crude (even semi-literate). It is sometimes misogynistic and adolescent. It frequently (but inconsistently) veers into quasi-archaic RenFaire English ... and it contradicts itself in ways both blunt and subtle.";
   say line break;
   say "But that [i]thread of enthusiasm[n] still holds it together, in a way. Like [i]Encounter Critical,[n] and like Leeman[apostrophe]s own best work (I[apostrophe]m most often reminded of [i]Kilkenny Carmichael Just Killed the King[n]), this is a [i]sincere[n] work, even an innocent work, for better or worse.";

   say "Vanth is a planet in the Medieval Rim of the galaxy, where most of the worlds still practice magic heavily and rely on it rather than technology. Many of the natives of Vanth are not aware of the galaxy at large except as rumors of [Quotation Mark]angels[Quotation Mark] and [Quotation Mark]sky monsters.[Quotation Mark] Technology is similar to that of Earth in the 8th-15th century.";
   say line break;
   say "Technology came to Vanth when the Vulkin Star Empire established a starport there to begin trading, but they were careful to present themselves as supernatural visitors from the heavens, and the starport is known as God City, deep in the north mountains. For years there was peaceful trade for swords made of god-metal (which is only modern steel) and similar trinkets, while the Vulkin governors shipped away starships loaded down with native gold and magical potions for the empire[']s coffers. The starport grew and God City became a mighty metropolis, but one very difficult for all but the most intrepid citizens of Vanth to reach safely, since the mountains are treacherous and full of dangerous cracks leading to the netherworld.";
   say line break;
   say "All was well until galactic war disrupted the sector power grid, robbing God City of its ability to provide a safe launching beam for starships, and shutting off communication with the rest of the galaxy. The fate of the Vulkin Star Empire itself is unknown on Vanth, and for 11 local years there has been no word, and so millions of galactic citizens and traders have been stranded in God City, forced to learn more local ways and to try to get along (even with the Klengons). Trade has begun to slow, since the God City supply of advanced goods has dried up along with the power beams. The spread of aliens into Vanth society has caused interesting mixing of peoples, and while nobody really believes God City is the home of [Quotation Mark]angels[Quotation Mark] anymore, those displaying alien technology are still regarded with a mix of fear and mistrust, especially in rural or cannibal regions. Players may be either locals to this magical world, or stranded galactic travelers of any sort who have decided to [Quotation Mark]go native[Quotation Mark] and become adventuring explorers. God City itself is now growing outward, with dismantled spacecraft slung over with fabric and hide to make durable shelters and so forth.[run paragraph on]";

But during its commercial release, a lot of the writings on [i]ToaSK[n] came from the Interactive Fiction community: the crew keeping the text-adventure torch burning bright (with [i]hundreds[n] of new games each year), and who take it (as a rule) a lot more seriously than [i]ToaSK[n] does (or at least, more seriously than [i]ToaSK[n] admits to).

   say line break;
   say "Calling the game interactive fiction could perhaps be questioned. The Z-code parser has been reduced to six commands; gameplay consists mainly of primitive randomized combats and moving around the map; the story is nearly non-existent; items have rarely any descriptions (on the plus side there are many library messages so the items look like they were described). It felt more like playing a low-end Nethack clone than a work of IF.";

   say twobreak;
   say "Every so often, I come across a game that I cannot understand why it was made. TOASS (how's that for an acronym?) is one of those games. First, the underpinnings are gimmicky. IF based on an RPG from an alternate universe? Why? Second, the game is far too difficult. I heart RPGs majorly, but nothing sucks more than a game which you can't get past the first monster. TOASS is one such game. Third, the writing style is purposefully worse than an overdramatic grade-Z drive-in flick. It's not humorous because it's everpresent and unavoidable. Fourth, well, I don't even have a fourth, but my heart goes out to the author. Some people miss the mark by accident, but some miss the mark on purpose. To say that TOASS is worse than a Paul Panks adventure is probably not sufficient, because Pank's work at least had a sort of innocent incompetence about it. TOASS is bad on purpose, and is sufficiently well-designed so that you can't miss the point. People who enjoy RPGs won't enjoy this as it's like being slapped repeatedly. People who don't like RPGs will find it insufferable. TOASS seems designed to drive away anyone interested in playing it. I suppose there's a challenge in that and only people who won't let a game have the final word will survive this game.";

   say "[i]Treasures of a Slaver's Kingdom[n] tears down all the standard rules of design in its chosen medium, piles them in a heap, hacks the heap to splinters, burns the splinters to ash, and scatters the ashes on a blood-red sea.";
   say line break;
   say "The results are pure awesome.";
   say line break;
   say "In form, this is interactive fiction. Over the course of amateur IF development, there's been a movement towards more complete implementation and more literary story-telling: more descriptions of objects, more actions for the player to use on everything and sundry, more plausible settings, more logical solutions to puzzles, greater concern for literary values in story, and so on.";
   say line break;
   say "There has also been a compensatory school of authors and players who reject the literary nonsense (deeming it pretentious), and who prefer obvious puzzles and unsubtle implementation as more essentially fun. These are often the same people who dislike the term [quotation mark]interactive fiction[quotation mark] and consider [quotation mark]text adventure[quotation mark] more honest, or at least a better description of what they want to play.";
   say line break;
   say "Even by the standards of the latter group, though, [i]ToaSK[n] is decidedly retrograde. It gets rid of most of the standard IF vocabulary in favor of five major verbs chosen for their archaism: REGARD, SEIZE, USE, PARLEY, and ASSAIL. One can also JOURNEY in compass directions, and there are commands like PILLAGE and SHED to speed up the task of picking up and putting down objects. One might USE OIL WITH FENCE, USE COIN WITH MERCHANT, USE HEALING SPELL WITH ELF: USE is all things to all inanimate objects. (And some animate ones, too. USE VIRGIN means exactly what you think it should.) There's usually not too much doubt about whether to PARLEY or ASSAIL, either, since people are usually easily divided into the friendly and the hostile. As for REGARD, sure, you can look at things, but quite a few things have no individual description. Most of your time as a player will be spent traveling, USEing, and ASSAILing, with just the occasional PILLAGE and PARLEY for spice. In terms of interaction, this game is really really focused.";
   say line break;
   say "The result is two-fold. To start with, of course, we lose much of the freedom and unpredictability of a parser-based game, which can be either wonderful or annoying depending on your personal preferences and the thoroughness of the implementation. Second, we drastically simplify the puzzles, to the point where they're functionally equivalent to puzzles in point-and-click adventures. USE is like clicking on something; USE WITH is like clicking an inventory item and then clicking on something. It's possible to wander around in confusion because we haven't yet found all the necessary props, but it's relatively hard to get confused about what to do with a critical item. Because the answer, naturally, is always to USE it.";
   say line break;
   say "So this isn't about grand story-telling, and it also isn't about complex puzzle solving -- not really. Where does the fun come from?";
   say line break;
   say "Well, here we have to back up. [i]Treasures of a Slaver's Kingdom[n] is set in the realm of Encounter Critical, a parodic RPG universe that makes a shameless smoothie of Star Wars, Star Trek, and Conan the Barbarian, with a little dash of Tolkien and probably quite a few other references I'm not geek-literate enough to recognize. There are wookies. There are [quotation mark]Klengons[quotation mark]. There are demon gods, sea monsters, and magical telepathic witches. Do not look here for consistency or reason. One runs into a couple Frankenstein's-monster sorts of creatures, and I think they stand as an emblem of the whole world: it's a crude patchwork of all the most memorable aspects of a dozen other settings. Encounter Critical predated S. John Ross's experiments with interactive fiction, which may at least answer the question of why someone would write a game that (falsely) purports to be a 1980s commercial work based on a (fake) role-playing game.";
   say line break;
   say "So what's fun about [i]ToaSK[n] -- and it is very fun -- is wandering around a setting that makes no sense and rips off lots of stereotypes, while solving largely straightforward puzzles and engaging in frequent semi- random battles with monsters of every kind.";
   say line break;
   say "And what makes *that* work is the complete and utter confidence of the writing, the smoothness of the game experience (I encountered no bugs and quite a few clever responses), the vividness of the action sequences, and the more or less ceaseless entertainment that both the player and the author are having at the expense of the protagonist. While you move this witless wonder of a barbarian around the map, occasionally powering up by finding a super new suit of armor or an even more macho sword, you're really also having a conversation with the author. It's a friendly, backstage conversation, probably conducted over some sort of malted beverage, about all the stories that you both enjoyed so much as kids and secretly still do enjoy. And because you and the author get pretty well in tune about what sort of ridiculous genre-tale this is, you're willing to manipulate the protagonist as the story and setting require, sending him into the most foolish dangers and the most obvious traps. The goal, in short, is not to sympathize or identify with the protagonist (as in a great deal of more serious IF) but to make him play out the role assigned for him.";
   say line break;
   say "[i]ToaSK[n] is probably not for everyone. The author, when he sent me a copy of the game, also said sheepishly that he was a little worried what I would think of its treatment of women.

I might have found this annoying if it were taking itself seriously, but since it really, really is not...";

Section of the Jimmy Maher SPAG Review

To say jimmymaherrev:
  say line break; 
  say "How much meta-fiction is enough? How much is too much? Your answers to these questions will likely have a lot to do with your perception of [i]Treasures of a Slaver[']s Kingdom[n], as will your age and cultural background. If you are a person of a certain age who played tabletop RPG[']s like [i]Dungeons and Dragons[n] and its derivatives during their commercial peak -- in other words, if you are an aging nerd -- you[']ll probably know just where this game is coming from. If not, you might just be utterly baffled by it. Luckily for Mr. Ross, many of us in the IF community are indeed aging nerds, and while that is perhaps a problem for the community[']s diversity and longterm health, it certainly gives this game a nice ready-made audience.";
  say line break;
  say "So, then, let[']s try to unpack the layers of this thing. Mr. Ross, a veteran independent tabletop RPG designer, has invented a sort of alternate nerd timeline in which a game called [i]Encounter Critical[n] was published in the late 1970[']s, just in time to catch the big tabletop RPG wave. [i]Encounter Critical[n] is much like [i]Dungeons and Dragons[n], but worse, at least from a worldbuilding point of view. It takes place in a generic fantasy universe with a healthy slab of science fiction slathered incoherently over the top, thus allowing the young nerd to get both his [i]Conan[n] and his [i]Star Wars[n] fixes in the same place. [i]Treasures[n] is a computerized game based on the [i]Encounter Critical[n] rules in which the player, as a buff but not terribly bright barbarian, attempts to defeat the evil overlord from whose slave pits he has just escaped. More importantly, he also gets to slaughter hordes of monsters, build up his statistics, and even work in a little hot and heavy action with a certain delicate doxy who embodies the male adolescent dream of the nubile female.";
  say line break;
  say "[i]Treasures[n], then, as Mr. Ross himself has not been shy to tell us on its website and in the newsgroups, is very, very bad. And yet, for the right player with the right background, it can be very, very good. The writing rises to dizzying heights of innocent [i]Eye of Argon[n]-esque splendor. Here[']s the PC[']s description, just to give a bit of the flavor:";
  say line break;
  say line break;
  say "[f]You have the savage bearing of an upland tribesman, quick like a THESKIAN MOUNTAIN CAT and cruel of eye, though [']tis truth that your heart is not unkind. Your mirth is as mighty as your gloom, and your ire as potent as your warmer passions.[n]";
  say line break;
  say line break;
  say "The game[']s technical implementation, at least at first blush, is as adolescent as the writing. Most of the standard IF verbs have been stripped away, leaving you only a bare handful with which to work. You can REGARD (i.e., examine) something; you can USE something; you can SEIZE (take) something; you can DISCARD (drop) something; and of course, and most importantly, you can ASSAIL (attack) someone or something. Other than the usual movement commands and meta-verbs, that[']s pretty much it. While guess the verb problems certainly aren[']t likely, anyone who is completely invested in IF as a serious literary form is probably shrieking at this rejection of the last thirty years of progress.";
  say line break;
  say "Those who are willing to take themselves and the form a little less seriously, though, may soon discover something else: for all its aggressive surface awfulness, [i]Treasures[n] is a superbly crafted little game that contains none of the usual annoyances of games of its (fictional) age and genre. You are provided with a clear map of the game[']s logically laid-out terrain; the puzzles are, fair, neither too difficult nor too trival, and surprisingly clever in light of the limited parser; and even the randomized combats are crafted in a logical stairstep pattern that means you will never have to fight an opponent who is too difficult to defeat. You will die plenty of times, but when a powerful monster kills you you can feel assured that the time is simply not yet right to fight him, that you should explore elsewhere and come back when you are stronger and better equipped. The monsters in fact play the role that locked doors do in much traditional IF, blocking access to those parts of the map you are not yet allowed to visit, and getting past one even carries with it the same little thrill of satisfaction. You can of course also attempt to game the system by saving before each combat and trying again and again for a favorable series of die rolls, and the surreally ridiculous ease of doing so is even part of the game[']s general ambience. Soon enough, though, you begin to have faith in the game[']s design and quit bothering.";
  say line break;
  say "There[']s of course no real literary value whatsoever to any of this, beyond a hazy, affectionate nostalgia for a bygone era in gaming. The central question thus becomes: is it fun? For me, yes, it is, surprisingly so. There is something hugely, childishly appealing about watching random numbers scroll over the screen, wondering if you or the deadly lizard maiden will run out of hit points first. Mr. Ross even manages to inject a surprising amount of variety into the simple combat formula by giving the later monsters a variety of attacks beyond the basic hack, slash, bite, and claw.";
  say line break;
  say "[i]Treasures[n] is unusual among modern IF in that it carries a price tag. Fortunately, Mr. Ross has made a demo version of the game available, which should be sufficient to judge whether it is indeed your cup of tea. If it is, you will find the full version a surprisingly lengthy adventure. I[']d estimate I spent a good eight to ten hours on it. The last few were perhaps not quite as enjoyable as those that came before, as there does come a point where the jokes have all pretty much been told at least once, where the many combats start to get a bit tedious, and where the whole thing flirts dangerously with becoming an all too typical cRPG slog. Before that quite happens, though, everything is wrapped up in a suitably rousing, over-the-top final combat.";
  say line break;
  say "[i]Treasures[n] is the sort of game that will inevitably only appeal to certain people. If it does resonate with you, though, you can feel confident that you are in for a big, well-designed game from an experienced creator. Much as I enjoyed [i]Treasures[n], I would be even more excited to see Mr. Ross bring his talents to something that doesn[']t have to live and die by its irony. And yet, and while I[']m not particularly excited about games like this turning into a long-term trend in IF, and could even point to its retro-gaming fixation as one of the things that still painfully hobbles the form today, I can[']t deny that [i]Treasures[n] kept me entertained. I can perhaps best describe it as a Paul Panks game that is actually competently designed and implemented. If such a description appeals to you, you[']re going to have a lot of fun with [i]Treasures[n]; if it doesn[']t, stay far, far away.";

The player likes her too, because she[']s got lots of useful plot information.";
   say line break;
   say "On the second or third visit, the Barbarian notices that the Doxy doesn[']t look like herself. She appears to have grown antennae and to be making a strange buzzing noise. But he assures himself that this is nothing to worry about, and is eager to proceed with the usual transaction.";

   say "Now the player, who has by this point seen several references to evil bee people, cannot possibly be so credulous as the protagonist. But when I played I felt no compunction about walking the protagonist into the obvious trap -- in fact, I [i]enjoyed[n] doing so. It was in character for him. It was much more interesting than getting away. Moreover, I was pretty sure that whatever happened next, I wasn[']t going to ruin the game for myself.";
   say line break;
   say "Several things have to happen to create a context for such dramatic choices. The connection between protagonist and player has to be attenuated a little: I have to sympathize with my protagonist while at the same time not feeling that my fate is bound into his. My primary commitment has to be to the story, rather than to my avatar. That allows me to enjoy and get something out of a narrative that features set-backs for the character. And there has to be a guarantee of safety. I[']m not going to play with the interesting but potentially negative outcomes nearly as much if I think they might later interfere with my ability to finish the story.";
   say line break;
   say "[quotation mark]Treasures[quotation mark] addresses all of these points. It accomplishes the player/protagonist separation through one of the most straightforward means available: it draws the protagonist as significantly less intelligent than the player. The text of the game frequently describes things in such terms that the player understands them better than the protagonist (a trick also used by the award-winning [quotation mark]Lost Pig[quotation mark]).";
   say line break;
   say "This is not difficult to do in prose, since a reader will often recognize from a literal physical description what something must be, even if the protagonist doesn[']t know the name of what he[']s looking at. A graphical interface would have to work harder to create such a separation between protagonist and player perception, perhaps offering access to the protagonist[']s thoughts via a voice-over or other hints; and the characterization still needs to be deft enough that the player enjoys spending time with his stupid protagonist, even while looking down on him.";
   say line break;
   say "[quotation mark]Treasures[quotation mark] also takes full advantage of the conventions of its genre. The barbarian warrior is supposed to be proud, strong, and stupid, so [quotation mark]Treasures[quotation mark] plays that to the hilt: the protagonist frequently notices the manliness of his own thews. The player is more or less forced to regard him as an example of a type, rather than a fully-fleshed person.";
   say line break;
   say "Finally, [quotation mark]Treasures[quotation mark] makes it feel safe to experiment with the dramatic possibilities through external assurances that the game will never become unwinnable: as the website memorably puts it, [quotation mark]If your arm falls off, that[']s part of the story, I promise.[quotation mark][line break]";
   say line break;
   say "This still doesn[']t get us all the way to interactive tragedy. [quotation mark]Treasures[quotation mark] is certainly not one, and some of the techniques it uses wouldn[']t be appropriate for a tragedy meant to be taken seriously. [quotation mark]Make the protagonist thicker than bricks[quotation mark] isn[']t exactly a design methodology suitable for all seasons.";
   say line break;
   say "Some of the other techniques are more widely applicable, though: guaranteeing that the story will never become unfinishable; offering the player options that are in-character but disadvantageous to the protagonist; and setting up scenes in which the question of what[']s behind the door marked DANGER is just too fascinating to leave unexplored.";
   say line break;
   say "The player[']s curiosity provides a game-play reason to try the dangerous action. The protagonist[']s flaws (if not stupidity, then pride, vanity, greed...) provide the narrative justification.";

   say twobreak;
   say "There[']s been a lot of talk about the literary antecedents of [i]Dungeons & Dragons[n], and TV shows reflecting the eclectic design ethos of the early days. But (to my knowledge) there[']s been relatively little talk about that other medium influencing and reflecting early [i]Dungeons & Dragons[n] play: interactive fiction, a/k/a [quotation mark]text adventures[quotation mark] like [i]Zork, Wishbringer[n] and [i]A Mind Forever Voyaging[n].";
   say line break;
   say "To make a long post somewhat shorter, here are two points I want to raise:";
   say twobreak;
   say "   [b]1.[n] Back in the day, these sorts of adventure games were about as good as CRPG[']s got, and they were a significant part of the Geek-geist, at least among those of us who began playing [i]D&D[n] with the B/X or BECMI stuff of the early 1980[']s. I think the feedback between tabletop RPG[']s and these sorts of zany adventure games-primitive gaming tech that nevertheless required you to [quotation mark]imagine the hell out of it[quotation mark] or face sadistic peril-isn[']t sufficiently acknowledged in the Old School Renaissance.";
   say line break;
   say "   [b]2.[n] This may reveal my shameful ignorance, but interactive fiction has been subject to an Old School Renaissance of its own!  These guys are still going strong: 25 years after these sorts of games ceased to be commercially viable, there is a thriving interactive fiction fan & writing scene!  They[']ve got several contests, guidelines for how to write this stuff, and many of them are trying their best to push the limits of the form. Obviously they[']re doing very well for themselves and don[']t need validation from the likes of us, but I had no idea they even existed and am very pleased that they[']re keeping the genre alive.";
   say line break;
   say "If you[']re curious about interactive fiction, either because you are a young whippersnapper or, like me, weren[']t paying attention for the last twenty years, here are some of the ones that get a lot of critical acclaim:";
   say twobreak;
   say "   [b]•[n] [i]Treasures of a Slaver[']s Kingdom[n], by S. John Ross. If you[']re brand-new to this, like I am, this is a decent place to start as it[']s based on an Old School Role-Playing Game ([i]Encounter Critical[n]). The full version costs $9.95 but there[']s a free demo. This is perhaps the funniest game I[']ve played in ages. If you ever ask yourself, [quotation mark]What[']s it like to play with the New York Red Boxers?[quotation mark] the tone of this game comes very, very close, particularly to Tavis[']s White Sandbox shenanigans. (My score is 457 points in 1724 turns. I imagine others can do better-but I scoff at your efforts all the same, poltroon!)";

Section of Interactive Fiction and the Map

To say artefactual:
   say line break;
   say "[b]Extract from ‘Interactive Fiction and the Map: Cartographic Genealogy of the Text Adventure Game’[n]";
   say twobreak;
   say "...[i]Treasures of a Slaver's Kingdom[n] (Ross, 2007a; henceforth, [i]ToaSK[n]) arguably represents the polar opposite of [i]Blue Lacuna[n] (Reed 2009). As an [']old-school['] text adventure game, featuring treasure-gathering, randomised combat, and a numerical score, [i]ToaSK[n] can be viewed in terms of the periodic [']returns to the source['] that Pierre Bourdieu (1993) has observed to take place in the history of art and literature: in this case, a return to the earliest interactive fiction, and to the roots of interactive fiction in early tabletop roleplaying games (especially [i]Dungeons & Dragons[n]). But as Bourdieu recognised, such returns are never innocent, which brings us to the key opposition between the two works: while [i]Blue Lacuna[n] develops the hyperdiegetic potential of interactive fiction to the furthest extent yet attempted in a text adventure game, doing everything possible to create and foster the illusion that it reveals a consistent and coherent world of limitless depths, [i]ToaSK[n] proclaims its nature as surface, as construction, confounding all expectations of hyperdiegesis. One sees this in its prose, which slips between Modern and Early Modern English pronouns and verb endings in affectionate parody of sword-and-sorcery narration ([']The RUIN SLUG is staring at you... Thou art not stealthy enough to slip past a RUIN SLUG when the RUIN SLUG stareth upon thee[']). And one sees it in the studied absurdity of the puzzles, which mimic the bizarre chains of logically unrelated actions required to solve text and graphic adventure games from the 1980s: the viewpoint character must give his sword to a devil worshipper in order to obtain from him a jewel that he must give to a courtesan in order to obtain from her a document that he must give to the same devil worshipper in order to obtain from him some incense that he must set fire to in order to get himself expelled from a sea monster's digestive tract, which he must enter in order to obtain an eyepatch with which to disguise himself as a pirate. This anti-hyperdiegetic approach is taken still further in [i]ToaSK’s[n] framing narrative, which presents the work as an enthusiast’s reconstruction of an unreleased commercial text adventure game from 1979 – a text adventure game, moreover, which was itself the product of negotiations between a computer games company and a tabletop roleplaying games company – negotiations that descended into [']bitter arguments over features, rules interpretations, and the game’s scope.['] (Ross, 2007b) In this way, every detail of the work becomes a signifier of its artefactuality and – moreover – an explicit reflection upon the genealogy of interactive fiction. Such a radical textual strategy would appear to have been taken in no other text adventure game, for which reason I feel justified in referring to [i]ToaSK[n] as the purest example to date of postmodernism in interactive fiction.";
