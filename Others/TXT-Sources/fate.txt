[WARNING: this source code is too big to actually compile+play in Inform 7, because debug versions exceed the z8 format. You can Release it, though: without the debug code it just fits. The most important TODO for OpenFate is to make it Glulx-compatible. We also need to check that switching to later versions of Inform 7 has not introduced any new bugs.][Because Fate isunder the GPL, and because I will actively invite other people to change the source code, it will be extensively commented. Please follow this practice if you add or change any code.]Part 0 - General rules and conventions[This part defines the scenes, some general flags, some verbs and some kinds. It also contains definitions of the introduction, the player character and the included extensions.]Chapter 0.1 - General flags and dependenciesUse no scoring and full-length room descriptions. [No score is kept in this game. The game is in verbose mode standardly.]Include Simple Chat by Mark Tilford. [This extension is needed for all the menu-based conversations in the game. IMPORTANT!!! I use a slightly different version of SC, and this is crucial. In the extension, change "made from 0 to rowcount" to "made from 1 to rowcount" if you plan to compile a public release.][Include Mistype by Cedric Knight.] [I would like to include this extension, but it leads to errors. Try "x sleeeeep" in the Inform IDE.]Include Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short. [Needed for 'wait for any key' and some other screen effects.]Include Locksmith by Emily Short. [Automates unlocking doors. Only useful for the pixie cage, currently.]Include Adaptive Hints by Eric Eve. [I manually disabled the "first time" hint message, because it seemed inappropriate.]Include Basic Help Menu by Emily Short.remembered_person is a person that varies. [I am using this global variable somewhere to store a person. It would be better if we could do without.]Vision is a kind of value. The visions are viper_bite, killed_by_Harold, banished, glorious_kingdom, glorious_rebel, glorious_free, rebel_warned, happy and rebel_sorry. [The visions define the possible endings of the game, as well as what you see when you look in the crystal ball. Viper_bite: the player is killed by a viper which Harold has left in her bed. (Initial.)Killed_by_Harold: the baby is killed by an agent of Harold's. (By removing the viper.)Banished: mother and child are banished from the land for what you have done to Harold. (By making Harold mad.)Glorious_kingdom: mother dies, child becomes glorious fighter for the kingdom. (By summoning the demon.)Glorious_rebel: mother dies, child becomes glorious fighter for the rebels. (By summoning the demon.)Glorious_free: mother dies, child becomes glorious fighter for the entire country. (By summoning the demon.)Rebel_warned: mother and child die for the good cause. (By summoning the demon.)Happy: mother dies, child goes off to lead a happy life somewhere far from all politics. (By summoning the demon.)Rebel_sorry: mother and child die for a cause that, in the last moments, was shown to be not that important. (By summoning the demon, then repenting in the last moves.)Rebel_sorry cannot be seen in the crystal ball, because it can only be accessed in the last moves of the game, when the ball is no longer accessible.]Fate is a vision that varies. Fate is viper_bite. [The initial fate is Viper_bite. Change this to test different endings.]Endgame is a thing. Endgame is either started or unstarted. Endgame is unstarted. [Dirty hack to allow us to start Giving Birth by changing a property of an object. There is no command to simply start a scene.]Giving Birth is a scene. Giving Birth begins when endgame is started. [When Giving Birth starts, the player is transported to the bedroom and can only examine, look and push.]Rule for deciding whether all includes scenery: it does not. [Take all, and things like that, do not include scenery.]Chapter 0.2 - When the game beginsWhen play begins: display the boxed quotation"Men at some time are masters of their fates:The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,But in ourselves, that we are underlings.-- Cassius to Brutus in 'Julius Caesar', Act I, Scene 2";  show the current quotation; [Shows the quotation in a clear window.]  wait for any key;  say "You are nine months pregnant, and the contractions have already begun. Trapped in a castle with more enemies than friends, and Queen in name but not in influence, you fear for the future of your child. But your spells have finally worked, and now your crystal ball shows what fate awaits him. If you act with speed and determination, and if you are willing to do what is necessary, you may still have time to influence your son's destiny before the waters break." [The initial text.]After printing the banner text, say "This work is licensed under the GNU Public License, version 2 or later. [line break]Type HELP for more information, or HINTS if you get stuck.".Chapter 0.3 - The player characterThe player is carrying the velvet pouch. [See Chapter 1.1 for this object.]The player wears a scarlet gown. The description of the gown is "The gown, made of a satin the colour of blood, is richly embroidered with gold thread. Two rows of pearls adorn the hem." The thread is part of the gown. The description of the thread is "Abstract designs of occult significance catch the light whenever you move." Understand "designs" as the thread. Instead of taking off the gown, say "Walking around in your underwear would make even fewer people take you seriously." Understand "gold thread" as the thread. Understand "dress" as the gown. Instead of cutting the gown: try cutting the pearls.The pearls are part of the gown. The pearls is either complete or incomplete. The pearls is complete. [Influences the description of the gown.] The description of the pearls is "Small but perfect, their iridescent colours dazzle the eye. They have been glued to the gown. [if the pearls are incomplete]One pearl is missing from the hem, but only close inspection will show. [end if][line break]". Understand "rows" and "row" as the pearls.The pearl is a a thing. The description of the pearl is "Small but perfect, its iridescent colours dazzle the eye." [You can get the pearl by cutting the pearls with the dagger.]Understand "pearl" as the pearls when the pearl is not visible and the pearl dust is not visible. [So that "cut pearl" works as expected.]Instead of taking the pearls: say "They are glued to the hem of your gown. You might cut one loose with a sharp object.".Instead of cutting the pearls:  if the pearls are incomplete, say "Ruining your dress further will serve no purpose." instead;  if player does not have the dagger and the dagger is not touchable, say "You will need a sharp object, such as your dagger." instead;  if player does not have the dagger and the dagger is touchable, move the dagger to the player;  say "Using the ceremonial dagger, you carefully cut one of the pearls from your robe. It hardly shows.";  change the pearls to incomplete;  move the pearl to the player.Instead of examining the player: say "You are Catherine, barely twenty years old, dressed in a regal gown and--at least in name--the Queen of the Realm[if the player wears the amulet]. The Amulet of Madness hangs around your neck[end if]. For the past nine months, a little prince has been growing in your belly. You suspect he'll be coming out any moment now."The baby is part of the player. The description of the baby is "Now and then you can feel your little sweetheart move inside of you." Instead of listening to the baby: say "Sometimes you imagine you can hear him laugh or cry." Understand "child" as the baby. Understand "prince" as the baby.A person is either healthy or diseased. The player is healthy. [The player becomes diseased when doing a blood offering to the imp. See the disease rule in 0.7.] Your wrist is part of the player. The indefinite article is "your". The description of your wrist is "[if the player is healthy]You see nothing particular about your wrist.[otherwise]Red spots mark the teeth of the imp.[end if]". [The imp bites your wrist, therefore the player may wish to examine it. Also, perfume is applied to the wrist.] Your belly is part of the player. The indefinite article is "your". The description of your belly is "Your belly has swollen to a considerable size, as it contains your soon-to-be-born baby.".A person is either poisoned or unpoisoned. The player is unpoisoned. [The player character is poisoned when she has applied the belladonna paste to her lips in order to cast Haunt on the King. Before that and after kissing him she is unpoisoned. Has no other effect than to regulate that scene.]Chapter 0.4 - Standard responsesInstead of singing: say "You are too shy to raise your voice, and just hum tunelessly."Instead of jumping: say "A pregnant woman, hopping up and down like a frog? It's hard enough to just stand."Instead of saying sorry: say "You mumble something apologetic under your breath."Instead of swearing mildly: say "You curse your luck."Instead of swearing obscenely: say "You mutter a suitably dark oath."Instead of thinking: say "Yes; only clear thought and daring will avail you now."Instead of pushing or pulling or taking a fixed in place thing: say "You might not even be able to move that at other times, but you are certainly not able to move it now.".Chapter 0.5 - New kinds and actionsSection 0.5.1 - Servant[Since there are only two servants, this may be a bit overkill. But it makes it easy to add more. All servants can be stabbed to refill the ceremonial dagger.]A servant is a kind of person.Instead of attacking a servant (called the slapped):   if player has the ceremonial dagger, say "If you wish to slap [the slapped], please use 'slap [the slapped]'. If you wish to stab [the slapped] with the ceremonial dagger, please use 'stab [the slapped]'.";  else try slapping the slapped. [Attacking a servant can be either slapping or stabbing. If the player does not have the dagger, slapping is default.]A body is a kind of thing. A body is part of every servant. The description of a body is "[if the body is part of something]A normal, human body.[otherwise]The body lies in a pool of blood.[end if]". A body is usually scenery. Understand "corpse" as a body. [This is not very beautiful, but is allows us to leave a body after the servant has been killed. If you know a better solution, please consider implementing it.]Instead of taking a body (called the thingy): if the thingy is not part of something, say "That is far too heavy for you to lift--and you would get blood all over your clothes." instead.Persuasion rule for asking servants to try doing something: say "Little use attempting to order around the servants. They'll bow and smile, then go on with their tasks as usual." instead. [You can't order the servants around. Why not? It is far too much work to implement that.]Section 0.5.2 - Slapping[At the moment, slapping serves no real purpose in the game. It is referenced by the servant kind above.]Slapping is an action applying to one visible thing. Understand "slap [someone]" as slapping.Check slapping:   if the noun is not a person, say "Only people can be slapped." instead;   if the noun is not a servant, say "It would be discourteous to slap [if the noun is female]her[otherwise]him[end if]." instead;Carry out slapping:   say "You slap [the noun] hard across the face. 'Get out of my sight, you lazy [if the noun is female]wench[otherwise]knave[end if]!'".Instead of slapping the player:   say "You are quite awake already."Section 0.5.3 - Stabbing[Stabbing allows you to refill the dagger.

[This presupposes that everyone is either a servant or a noble. Custom messages for the goat, the imp, the demon and the player have been created, but creating a 'Blood' or 'noble' kind might be a better idea.]Carry out stabbing:   change remembered_person to the noun;   run a conversation from c_stabbing.Instead of stabbing the player:   say "And risk killing your baby?".[The conversation below gives the player the option to carry out the stabbing or refrain from doing so. The psychological effect is that it feels worse to stab someone.]c_stabbing, c_stab_sorry, c_stab_dont are chat nodes.Instead of giving text for c_stabbing: say "You hide the knife behind your back as you approach [remembered_person]."Instead of finding responses to c_stabbing: link to c_stab_sorry; link to c_stab_dont.Instead of giving link to c_stab_sorry: say "Whisper: 'I'm so sorry, [remembered_person]. I have to do it; the future of my child is at stake.' ".Instead of giving text for c_stab_sorry: say "With one swift movement, you stab [remembered_person] in the heart. [if remembered_person is female]She[otherwise]He[end if] dies almost immediately, blood bubbling from [if remembered_person is female]her[otherwise]his[end if] mouth. Mystical power surges through you, and when you pull the dagger out of [if remembered_person is female]her[otherwise]his[end if] heart, you notice that it shines with renewed vigour.";   repeat with item running through bodies begin;     if the item is part of the remembered_person, move the item to the location; [See the body declaration in the servant type.]     now the item is not scenery;   end repeat;   Remove the remembered_person from play;   Change the dagger to loaded.Instead of giving link to c_stab_dont: say "Gods, no, how could you do such a thing?

Understand "look up [text]" as looking up a spell when the location is the den. [In the den (where the grimoire always is), 'look up ...' will cause a looking up in the grimoire.]Instead of looking up a spell:  if the grimoire is not visible, say "You will need the grimoire for that." instead;  try consulting the grimoire about the topic understood.Section 0.5.5 - Talking toTalking to is an action applying to one visible thing.

Understand "grind [something]" as grinding. Understand "pulverise [something]" as grinding. Understand "pulverize [something]" as grinding.Check grinding:  if the mortar is not touchable, say "You will need a mortar and pestle." instead.Carry out grinding:  if the noun is not the pearl and the noun is not the pixie wings, say "There is no use grinding that." instead;  if the noun is the pearl, say "It is heavy work, but with the mortar and pestle you grind the pearl into a fine dust. You carefully pick up the dust.";  if the noun is the pearl, remove the pearl from play;  if the noun is the pearl, move pearl dust to player;  if the noun is the pixie wings, say "Within seconds, the mortar and pestle turn the wings into dust.  You carefully pick up the dust.";  if the noun is the pixie wings, remove the pixie wings from play;  if the noun is the pixie wings, move pixie dust to player.Some pearl dust is a thing.

Understand "pump [something]" as pumping. Understand "blow [something]" as pumping.Check pumping:   if the noun is not the bellows, say "You cannot pump that." instead.Carry out pumping: say "You move the bellows a few times.

Faint wisps of magic linger in the air."Check going south when the player is in the sorcerer's den:  if the player has the grimoire, say "A woman as close to giving birth as you are shouldn't be carrying a hefty tome like the grimoire about." instead;  if the player has the mortar, say "A woman as close to giving birth as you are shouldn't be carrying such a heavy mortar and pestle about." instead;  if fate is not viper_bite and fate is not killed_by_Harold and fate is not banished begin;    now endgame is started;    say "Loud noises coming from the parlour stop you in your tracks." instead;  end if;  say "You open the heavy curtain, pulling it close again behind you.".Instead of waiting when the player is in the sorcerer's den:  run a conversation from sc_waiting_1.sc_waiting_1, sc_waiting_2, sc_waiting_3 are chat nodes.Instead of giving text for sc_waiting_1: say "Would you like to stop interfering with fate and see the current fate materialise?"Instead of finding responses to sc_waiting_1: link to sc_waiting_2; link to sc_waiting_3.Instead of giving link to sc_waiting_2: say "Yes.

It is ready to be used.[end if]".

The walls are adorned by three paintings and a huge mirror, none of them to your taste. Luckily, there are three routes of escape: your den lies to the north, your bedroom to the east, and the rest of the castle can be reached by the staircase to the west."Before going north in the parlour:   say "You open the heavy curtain, pulling it close again behind you.".Before going west in the parlour:  if Sir Charles is awake, activate the Table of Sleep Hints;  if Sir Charles is awake and Sir Charles is calm, say "'I have strict orders not to let you leave these rooms, my lady.', Sir Charles intervenes." instead;  Now Sir Charles is calm;  if Sir Charles is awake, say "'What?

The sorcerer's den, the parlour and the bedchamber are in Catherine's apartment.Part 2 - The CorridorsA room called The Corridors is west of the parlour. "The corridors of the castle twist and turn endlessly through all the towers and keeps. At the top of the northwestern tower is Mebeira's lair, where you sometimes go to talk about sorcery. Your husband's quarters lie to the west, whereas your own are to the east and those of Prince Harold are situated in the northern keep. Taking the stairs down will bring you to an enclosed garden."Instead of going west in the corridors when the player has the goat: say "Walking around the castle with a goat might arouse suspicion.".

"You have never found out, or inquired, where Mebeira sleeps. Her single tower room is cluttered with stuffed animals, open jars containing evil-coloured powders, dirty plates and mugs, black clothes decades out of fashion, human skulls, yellowed books, trunks and cabinets almost hidden under the undisturbed dust of years, and dozens of objects that may look magical to the uninitiated but appear useless to your trained eye. And yet, you know that Mebeira has real powers."Section 3.1 - General thingsThe debris is here. It is scenery.

The description of the debris is "It is a simply astounding collection of junk. Who knows what treasures might be hidden among it?". Instead of searching the debris, say "You are not going to find out whether any treasures are to be found among the junk, because it would take far too much time to search through it--not to mention that Mebeira might not approve.". Instead of taking the debris, say "You have no use for any of the junk you see.".The trunks are here. They are scenery. Understand "cabinets" and "cabinet" and "trunk" as the trunks. The description of the trunks is "They haven't been touched in years, and probably contain nothing but mouldering clothes.". Instead of opening the trunks, say "Truly, it would be a waste of time, even if Mebeira would let you.".The tiger skin is here. It is scenery. "The skin of a tiger has been draped over a pile of cushions to provide a comfortable seat. You've never seen Mebeira anywhere but on it.". Instead of taking the skin, say "Mebeira is sitting on it.".Section 3.2 - MebeiraMebeira is here. Mebeira is a woman. "Mebeira, that old witch, reclines on the skin of a tiger." The description of Mebeira is "She must be over sixty, several years older than the King, her brother. She hasn't aged as well as he has: her face is wrinkled and haggard, her eyesight is weak, and her once sharp mind now sometimes seems to wander.". Understand "witch" as Mebeira.Instead of talking to mebeira: run a conversation from sc_mebeira_1.The dried piece of belladonna is a thing. It is carried by Mebeira. The description is "Small, brown and probably not even poisonous any longer, this is all that remains of a once proud and deadly belladonna plant.". Instead of eating the dried piece, say "Let's not take any chances.".The Amulet of Madness is a thing. The description of the amulet is "This evil pendant, bright red lines on a circular plate of gold, has a fearsome magical power. The first person to attack the wearer with the intent to kill him or her will be struck with immediate and incurable madness." The Amulet is wearable. Mebeira is wearing the amulet. The amulet is either available or unavailable. The amulet is available. [If you put the game into a state where the amulet can no longer be gotten from Mebeira, it becomes unavailable. This is checked by routines that check whether your fate can still be changed: currently the coins and the hints.][Source created by DLGC from source file G:\Interactive Fiction\Dialogue\Dialogues\Fate_Mebeira_2.DCP]sc_mebeira_1 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_2 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_4 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_6 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_16 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_18 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_20 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_22 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_66 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_107 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_159 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_161 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_186 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_188 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_216 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_218 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_280 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_282 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_415 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_419 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_498 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_578 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_580 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_634 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_636 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_796 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_799 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_1071 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_1245 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_1247 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_1249 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_1316 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_1446 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_1517 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_1519 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_2524 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_2682 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_2767 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_2769 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_2858 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_3571 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_3665 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_3667 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_4339 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_4341 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_4343 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_4869 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_4871 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_4873 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_4875 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_4877 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_5923 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_6048 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_6050 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_6800 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_7183 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_7450 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_7723 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_7725 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_1023 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_1025 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_1027 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_2046 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_2198 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_2353 is a chat node. sc_mebeira_2816 is a chat node. Instead of giving text for sc_mebeira_1: say "You address Mebeira, your sorcerous mentor and sister-in-law.".Instead of finding responses to sc_mebeira_1: link to sc_mebeira_2; link to sc_mebeira_4; if the player has the fresh belladonna plant and the player has the pinch of ash and the player has the handkerchief, link to sc_mebeira_6; link to sc_mebeira_16; link to sc_mebeira_18; link to sc_mebeira_20; link to sc_mebeira_22.Instead of preparing sc_mebeira_2: do nothing.Instead of giving link to sc_mebeira_2: say "'I have done everything I could, and yet my baby's future seems grim and dire!'

"This is a barren hallway, just like all the other corridors in the castle; plain cold stone, and not an object of art and beauty in sight. A sturdy guard called Rudolph stands next to the solid doors that lead into the King's apartment to the west. The rest of the castle lies east."Section 4.0.1 - General thingsThe stone is here. It is scenery. The description of the stone is "Hard and merciless. It has neither the potential of metal, nor the meaning of wood. You dislike it.".The solid doors are here. They are scenery.

Rule for deciding whether all includes the red nose: it does not. The description of the red nose is "Yes, it is quite red.".The description of Rudolph is "Rudolph is strong, fiercely loyal and not too bright. For these three reasons, he is your husband's personal guard.".Before going west from the King's Hallway: if the state of suspicion of Rudolph is less than 7, activate the Table of Rudolph Hints; if the state of suspicion of Rudolph is less than 7, say "'I am not allowed to let you pass, Queen Catherine,' the guard intervenes." instead; say "Rudolph sniggers as he lets you through.".[Source created by DLGC from source file G:\Interactive Fiction\Dialogue\Dialogues\Fate_Rudolph.DCP]sc_guard_1 is a chat node. sc_guard_2 is a chat node. sc_guard_5 is a chat node. sc_guard_7 is a chat node. sc_guard_804 is a chat node. sc_guard_9 is a chat node. sc_guard_11 is a chat node. sc_guard_47 is a chat node. sc_guard_70 is a chat node. sc_guard_116 is a chat node. sc_guard_118 is a chat node. sc_guard_193 is a chat node. sc_guard_265 is a chat node. sc_guard_267 is a chat node. sc_guard_354 is a chat node. sc_guard_356 is a chat node. sc_guard_358 is a chat node. sc_guard_497 is a chat node. sc_guard_969 is a chat node. sc_guard_971 is a chat node. sc_guard_1068 is a chat node. sc_guard_1122 is a chat node. sc_guard_1179 is a chat node. Instead of giving text for sc_guard_1: say "You approach Rudolph, the dutiful guard.".Instead of finding responses to sc_guard_1: if the state of suspicion of Rudolph is 1, link to sc_guard_2; if the state of suspicion of Rudolph is 2, link to sc_guard_5; if the state of suspicion of Rudolph is 3, link to sc_guard_7; if the state of suspicion of Rudolph is greater than 3 and the state of suspicion of Rudolph is less than 7, link to sc_guard_804; if the state of suspicion of Rudolph is greater than 6, link to sc_guard_9; link to sc_guard_11.Instead of giving link to sc_guard_2: say "'I would like to enter my husband's rooms, Rudolph.'

"A large table covered with maps features prominently in the spacious room; your husband, the King, walks around the table with [if the king is unhaunted]a scowl on his face, presumably planning a military campaign[otherwise]a haunted look in his eyes[end if]. Three large pictures adorn the walls, while doors lead east to the corridors and north to the King's bedroom."Every turn: if the King's Parlour is visited and the King's Parlour was not visited, say "'What are you doing here, woman?', your husband asks, but he doesn't seem to be very interested in your answer.".Section 4.1.1 - General stuffThe King's table is a thing. It is here. It is scenery. It is a supporter. Understand "large" as the King's table. The description of the King's table is "Nearly six by two metres and made of mahogany, this thing must have been assembled in the room itself. Its entire surface is currently covered by maps representing various parts of the kingdom.".The maps are on the King's table. The maps are scenery. Instead of taking the maps, say "Quite probably, your husband would not be happy with that. It might also rouse suspicion.". The description of the maps is "The maps show all the different parts of the kingdom, but most of them appear to be of your home province of Gondola--which is also the main focus of the insurrection. Estimates of the locations and strengths of various armies and armed groups have been written on them, and detailed tactical plans for a campaign against Gondola have been sketched in with pencil. The broad outlines of the plan are evident even to your untrained eye.". The plan is part of the maps. Understand "plans" as the plan. Understand "outlines" as the plan. The description of the plan is "King Alfred seems to be planning to send a small force along the main roads to Gondina, the seat of your family's power, which is presumably to serve as bait for Duke Albricht's forces in the lowlands. As soon as Duke Albricht pursues this army, his main force will cross the hills just west of Gras and make straight for the important ports of Calay and Gendo. Given Albricht's lack of patience, such a tactic might well work.".The King's portrait is a painting. The King's landscape is a painting. The King's war scene is a painting. The King's portrait, the King's landscape and the King's war scene are here. The description of the King's portrait is "An old, hard man in dinted armour grimly stares out of the frame. It is King Alfred I, your husband's father.". The description of the King's war scene is "It is almost identical to the painting that hangs in your room. A grisly scene, full of dying horses and people, clashing bands of armed men and a river running red with blood. A town to the right side of the painting is already ablaze. In the middle your husband is fighting your father in mounted combat--and you know all too well how that fight ended.". The description of the King's landscape is "The capital of the kingdom, looking ominously down from the hills on which it lies.".Section 4.1.2 - The KingThe King is a man. He is scenery. The King is in the King's Parlour. Understand "Alfred" as the King. Understand "husband" as the King. The King is either haunted or unhaunted. The king is unhaunted. The indefinite article is "the". The description of the king is "Your husband, thirty years your senior. [if the King is unhaunted]He married you for political reasons, hoping that your proud family and their vassals would be appeased by the gesture. Apparently, they were not; only six years have passed since your father was killed, but a new rebellion has already broken out.[otherwise]He looks about furtively, an almost fearful look in his eyes.[end if]".Instead of kissing the king: say "[if the player is poisoned]The spell will only work if you get the King to ask you for a kiss first--out of genuine affection.[otherwise]You kiss the King. He hardly seems to notice.[end if]".Instead of attacking the king: say "That would get you into too much trouble too soon.".Instead of talking to the king when the king is unhaunted: run a conversation from sc_king_1.Instead of talking to the king when the king is haunted: say "He doesn't react to your words, but looks at something--or someone--you cannot see."[Source created by DLGC from source file G:\Interactive Fiction\Dialogue_4_6\Dialogues\Fate_King.DCP]sc_king_1 is a chat node. sc_king_3 is a chat node. sc_king_10 is a chat node. sc_king_21 is a chat node. sc_king_31 is a chat node. sc_king_44 is a chat node. sc_king_46 is a chat node. sc_king_77 is a chat node. sc_king_79 is a chat node. sc_king_120 is a chat node. sc_king_146 is a chat node. sc_king_148 is a chat node. sc_king_180 is a chat node. sc_king_210 is a chat node. sc_king_334 is a chat node. sc_king_336 is a chat node. sc_king_446 is a chat node. sc_king_526 is a chat node. sc_king_608 is a chat node. sc_king_743 is a chat node. sc_king_745 is a chat node. sc_king_747 is a chat node. sc_king_1143 is a chat node. sc_king_1411 is a chat node. sc_king_1640 is a chat node. sc_king_1702 is a chat node. sc_king_1765 is a chat node. sc_king_1959 is a chat node. sc_king_1961 is a chat node. sc_king_2102 is a chat node. sc_king_2104 is a chat node. sc_king_2253 is a chat node. sc_king_2255 is a chat node. sc_king_2257 is a chat node. Instead of giving text for sc_king_1: say "You approach your husband, the King.".Instead of finding responses to sc_king_1: link to sc_king_3; link to sc_king_10; link to sc_king_21.Instead of giving link to sc_king_3: say "'Alfred, my lord!

"You have spent the night here only a handful of times, as the King prefers solitude. The bedroom isn't luxurious, but it is comfortable.

In this game, you take on the role of a pregnant woman who has the chance to influence her child's fate through her use of magic. As the game progresses, you will be able to strive for better and better destinies, but the price you will have to pay rises as well.[paragraph break]There are several endings to [italic type]Fate[roman type], but none of them are 'winning' or 'losing' endings; which ones are preferable is up to you to decide. (Most probably, though, the first two fates accessible to you will not seem very good.)[paragraph break][paragraph break]Because there are no 'winning' and 'losing' endings, you cannot technically put the game into an unwinnable state. You can, however, put the game into a state where changing your child's fate has become impossible. It should always be quite clear when this happens.[paragraph break][paragraph break]If at any time you wish to accept the fate currently visible in your crystal ball, all you have to do is WAIT in your den."Table of Basic Help Options (continued)title			subtable		description	toggle"Contacting the author"	--		"At the time of writing, March 2007, Victor Gijsbers can be contacted using the following mail address: victor@lilith.gotdns.org.

You were essential.[paragraph break][paragraph break]Ron Edwards for the independent roleplaying game [italic type]Sorcerer[roman type], which must have been an important influence on my design. (Influence is not transparent, not even to the one influenced.) Another probable influence is the computer roleplaying game [italic type]Planescape: Torment[roman type] (especially its use of conversation menus). Much interactive fiction must have been influential as well, but I don't know which particular games to point to."	--"License"		--		"This game is released under the GNU Public License version 2 or any later version.
