Moonscape is in Lunar Surface. The description of Moonscape is "Gazing out across the moonscape, you realize that there are no words to properly describe it.  Vast... unwelcoming... those are just the start.  If you had to put it into one word, it would be this: lonely." The printed name of Moonscape is "moonscape".Starry Sky is a backdrop. Starry Sky is in Lunar Surface. Understand "heaven" or "heavens" or "star" or "stars" as Starry Sky.  The description of Starry Sky is "The sky appears as a dark, enveloping blanket, studded with diamond-like stars which twinkle at you.  The two most prominent objects in the heavens are the Earth and the Sun." The printed name of Starry Sky is "starry sky".The Sun is a backdrop. The Sun is in Lunar Surface. Understand "Sol" or "Helios" as Sun.  The description of the Sun is "The light emanating from the sun takes only minutes to travel this far.  It's a shame there's not more atmosphere to trap some of that heat and keep you warm.  Better watch what you wish for, though - the people of Earth asked for an atmosphere that could retain heat and we all know what happened there, don't we now?" The printed name of Starry Sky is "starry sky".Outside Atlantean Base is a room.  Outside Atlantean Base is in Lunar Surface.  The description of Outside Atlantean Base is "You find yourself [if unvisited]lying on the ground outside the Atlantean Base.  You get up, dust yourself off, and begin to take in your surroundings.[otherwise]standing outside the Atlantean Base.[end if]  The silvery walls of the base rise tall into the starry sky, and seem to stretch on endlessly in either direction.  Behind you, to the south, lies a vast, unwelcoming expanse of moonscape.[if unvisited][paragraph break]You gaze up at the massive, silvery walls with a heavy heart - you don't see any way inside, at least not right off the bat.  Damn those Atlanteans and their treacherous ways.  They must have known you were coming, and built this giant wall just to thwart you!"  Instead of going south in Outside Atlantean Base, say "The moonscape draws on endlessly in that direction, desolate and barren.  Your destiny lies in front of you, inside the Atlantean Base."  Instead of going southeast in Outside Atlantean Base, say "The moonscape draws on endlessly in that direction, desolate and barren.  Your destiny lies in front of you, inside the Atlantean Base." Instead of going southwest in Outside Atlantean Base, say "The moonscape draws on endlessly in that direction, desolate and barren.  Your destiny lies in front of you, inside the Atlantean Base."  [Comment: I'll leave it to Mark to figure out how to get inside and what other responses the player might need here.]The Silvery Walls are scenery in Outside Atlantean Base.  Understand "endless" or "massive" or "base" or "Atlantean base" or "base" as the Silvery Walls.  The description of the Silvery Walls are "A sprawling silvery mass, yes.  And filled, no doubt, with treachery.  You [italic type]must [roman type] find a way inside!"  Instead of taking the Silvery Walls, say "They are too massive, too endless, too... silvery to take."Chapter 5.4 - The Ineffable AlmanacInstead of reading the Almanac:	choose a random row in the Table of Ineffable Wisdom;	say "Rather than start at the beginning of the Almanac, and having no curiosity in any specific entry in particular, you flip to a random page and begin reading at random:[paragraph break][response entry][paragraph break]Out of context, this may or may not make a whole lot of sense, but I suppose that's what you get for not looking up a specific entry."Table of Ineffable Wisdom (continued)topic	response"marmot" or "marmots"	"Marmots are generally large, extremely adorable ground squirrels.  They are denizens of the mountainous regions of the world.  Despite their unassuming cuteness, some silly historians suggest that marmots, rather than rats, were the primary carriers of the Bubonic plague during several historic outbreaks.  But they are so wonderful and charming they couldn't possible have brought so much suffering into the world.  Most marmots are highly social, and use loud whistles to communicate with one another, especially when alarmed.  They are also very curious critters, and will happily try to unzip the zippers on unattended backpacks to see what's inside.""fracture" or "fractures"	"Fracturing bones is usually quite painful and should generally be avoided as a matter of course.  Skeletal fractures can occur in an infinite number of ways, only a few of which are included here for the sake of brevity:[paragraph break]---> Getting lit and taking your lunar rover for a spin without due regard for the safety of yourself or others.[paragraph break]---> Getting lit, then challenging a boar grumptar to a wrestling match.[paragraph break]---> Getting lit and pretending you can fly over a lunar crater.[paragraph break]Please notice the common thread in all of these examples and remember the anti-binging slogan, kids: UNCHECKED DRINKING LEADS TO ABSENCE OF THINKING!  And [italic type]that's [roman type] one to grow on.""skeleton" or "bone" or "bones" or "skellington" or "cartilage"	"The skeleton, sometimes colloquially referred to as the 'skellington,' is the hardened structure (bones and cartilage) that provides a frame for the body of an animal.  This structure may be provided externally or internally.  In either case, the frame is not indestructible and care should be taken not to damage it.  SEE ALSO: fractures""drink" or "drinking" or "binge" or "binging"	"Drinking is the act of consuming a liquid through the mouth. Sometimes, this is a good thing.  Water, for example, is required for many of life's physiological processes.  However, 'drinking' may also refer specifically to the ingestion of alcohol, something which is strictly forbidden (or at least greatly frowned upon) in the Cosmic Law.""Cosmic Law" or "Law"	"Your notes on this are pretty simple: anything fun is generally against the Cosmic Law...[line break]...but then again, you're only guilty if you get caught.""boar" or "grumptar"	"Not to be confused with your Aunt Bertha, grumptars are a very dangerous species indeed.

A favorite prey of the Tasmanian devil (also mythical), wombats are generally thought to be shy herbivores.  Legend holds, however, that they possess sharp teeth and claws, can run at 40 km/hr, and have been known to kill the (equally mythical) dingo.  They have even been known to exist in vinyards.  That is, if they're actually real, which they're not.  But if they [italic type]were [roman type] real, it would also be interesting to note that their scat is cubical.""devil" or "Tasmanian devil" or "devils" or "Tasmanian devils"	"Tasmanian devils are mythical creatures from a made-up place called Tasmania, which is an island off of the (also fictional) continent of Australia.  They don't actually exist - just the sort of frightening stuff of scary bedtime stories, really - but legend tells of a small, dog-like marsupial known for its black fur, offensive odor when stressed, extremely loud and disturbing screech, and viciousness when feeding.""dingo" or "dingos" or "dingoes" or "warrigal" or "warrigals"	"Dingoes come in two sorts: the real dingoes, which only exist in Southeast Asia, and the mythical dingoes that eat babies from the fictional continent of Australia.  In either case, they're a wild dog a bit smaller than your average North American wolf.""wolf" or "wolves" or "North American wolf" or "North American wolves" or "American wolf" or "American wolves"	"Wolves are real, but generally not a danger to humans.  There are more important things to be afraid of... werewolves, for instance.  Or, if you're really into make-believe, dingoes.""werewolf" or "werewolves" or "lycanthrope" or "wolfman" or "werefolk"	"The werefolk are a dangerous sort - a cursed people who change from man to beast and back again whenever there is a full moon.  It's difficult to say which werewolves have it worse - the werewolves of Earth, who must endure changing back and forth whenever there is a full moon, or the werewolves on the Moon, where the Moon is - let's face it - always full.  Speculation has it that werewolves also exist on other planets, but to date this has not been proven, and so no information is available, say, on Martian werewolves.""wallaby" or "wallabies" or "wallabee" or "whallabee"	"Deceptively adorable, these mythical creatures from the fictional continent of Australia are smaller than their closely-related (though equally mythical) cousin, the kangaroo.  Seeing as how neither one exists, the dividing line between what constitutes a wallaby and what constitutes a kangaroo is somewhat arbitrary.  In general, a wallaby is smaller and stockier than a kangaroo, a kangaroo is generally larger and lankier than a wallaby, and a 'wallaroo' is what you call a specimen if you can't bring yourself to otherwise pigeon-hole the creature.  In myth, wallabies, kangaroos, and wallaroos live in a variety of habitats, and one can never be entirely certain that any given area is safe from their kicking feet and sharpened claws.

I've left 'Archive Lobby' undescribed so you can more easily add exits to it or what have you.  Playing just the above won't reveal what should be happening in the meta-story when the player gets to your section, but I've tested this with the code from Whispers 2, and your scene is the one where the player has decided to not actually end the game, but press on to find out what happened to his parents and possibly what's up with his aunt.  It would be nice if that thread was kept through Whispers 10, but we'll take what we can get.  And maybe something even more important will happen.  At any rate, feel free to add hints or other information to the Leslie and Ineffible Wisdom tables (using 'continued'), and we'll see if my meta-story works in the end.Also note that the player will need a portable object as well as a new room if they want to continue the meta-story; whether they can is up to you.  Also, they'll be able to remove random objects from play, which you shouldn't worry about (it's pretty clearly 'breaking the simulation', but you might think about making it the solution to a puzzle.If you want my copy of the Whispers 2 game with my meta-story imposed on it, I can send it to you.There are undoubtedly many bugs because I was pushing hard to get this out and figured I'd fix 'em later.

Whisper 8 begins when Whisper 7 ends.Whisper 8 ends when the player is in Small Chamber for the first time.[So lps has written this whole meta-story in which the player is told that he ("Dave") trapped is in this computer simulation that's mixing with his memories and needs to escape, because the simulator is supposed to run out of memory and wrap itself up somehow at the end of section ten. The person telling him this is a chyk called "Leslie" whom he can't see, but he can hear her voice, and can show her/tell her about places and things in the simulation to help her get a lock on him. And each time he does, she sends him objects that make up a "detangler", a gun-shaped object that's supposed to free you from the sim. I think that by the time we (the authors who come after lps' section) get to join in, the player has already decided to press on without using the detangler; doing so seems to have made you A) lose contact with Leslie, and B) lose the detangler. So the only players still playing are those who decided to not pursue that particular "win" condition.][LS note (added in the debugging phase):  this is not actually true, but is an interesting thing to note that Jota believed while coding his section ;-][So, the main story (the thing Leslie is claiming is just a sim) seems to have you currently exploring some Atlantean base in search of your parents. (Leslie claims they're actually dead in the real world). And you've got an almanac, and at some point an "Aunt Bertha" was mentioned. Lps' section of that is a room with lots of machinery (the "complex controls"), including a dial labelled 1-20. If you set it to 14, everything shakes and a crack in the wall opens up to the southeast leading you to a place called Archive Lobby (and the dial falls off in your hands).

The description of the quaking is "[if the quaking is stable]You can barely discern a faint, gentle humming under the floor.[otherwise]The ground seems to be trembling under your feet."The description of Archive Lobby is "Dozens of pigeon holes line the walls, most of them filled with what could only be scrolls. The ceiling of the room is paneled with some kind of crystalline material; the panels [if the quaking is stable]glow softly, providing a gentle illumination.[otherwise]flicker erratically, lighting the room in fits and bursts. A corridor leads east."After going to Archive Lobby for the first time: now the quaking is pending; continue the action.Every turn when the quaking is pending:   increase the counter of the quaking by one;  if the counter of the quaking is at least two begin;    now the quaking is unstable;    now the frequency of the quaking is a random number from 1 to 20;    say "You realize that the rumbling you felt earlier hasn't stopped completely.

"One of the scrolls has been left lying here on the floor. It looks badly damaged." The description of the damaged scroll is "This scroll is in bad shape. Not only is the handle broken off and the material itself fraying at the edges, but there are two distinct sets of text inscribed on it: the original Atlantean text, which you can make neither head nor tail of, and then a separate message written over that in black marker -- and in your mother's handwriting!"

The description of the colorful scroll is "Most of the text on this scroll is in a dialect that's utterly indecipherable to you. However, it does feature several colorful diagrams, and you notice that the numerals they're labeled with look remarkably like modern ones. Most of the pictures seem to depict complicated mechanisms that you can't quite follow, although there does seem to be a definite progression of colors from light blue, through green and then yellow, finally leading up to a reddish-orange. The simplest diagram you can find is made of gemotric shapes: two equilateral triangles. The message next to the smaller one includes the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. The larger one has a similar caption, but with the numbers 5, 10, 15, and 20."

The printed name of the Mechanism Room is "Crystal Mechanism Room". "This room seems to exist soley to house an elaborate mechanism[if the quaking is unstable] which is shaking dramatically[end if]. If you had to guess, you would say it looked like some kind of power generator -- although what kind of power it generates, you have no idea. A railing protects you from being injured by whatever it is. Or perhaps it prevents whatever it is from being damaged by you. An archway leads back north to the corridor."The railing is scenery in the Mechanism Room. The description of the railing is "Familiar and functional." Instead of climbing the railing, say "Better not. You wouldn't know what to do with the mechanism even if you could reach it, and there's no other exit from the room."The elaborate mechanism is scenery in the Mechanism Room. Understand "power" or "generator" or "levers" or "cables" or "platforms" or "pulleys" as the elaborate mechanism. The description of the elaborate mechanism is "Levers and cables and platforms and pulleys interlock like a giant nest to protect the metaphorical eggs within. The entire mechanism seems primarily focused around one very large crystal which is nestled deep within the structure. A smaller crystal is also mounted a short distance above it; it seems similar but clearly secondary in purpose. Perhaps it's there as a backup or to handle excess load.[if the quaking is unstable] The entire affair seems to be trembling in a most worrying manner."To say lccolor:  let div be the frequency of the quaking divided by 5;  if div is 0, say "perfectly clear";  if div is 1, say "cool blue";  if div is 2, say "green";  if div is 3, say "yellow";  if div is at least 4, say "firey orange".To say sccolor:  let div be the remainder after dividing the frequency of the quaking by 5;  if div is 0, say "perfectly clear";  if div is 1, say "cool blue";  if div is 2, say "green";  if div is 3, say "yellow";  if div is at least 4, say "firey orange".The large crystal is scenery in the Mechanism Room.

The printed name of the Spring Room is "Spring Mechanism Room". Understand "spring mechanism" or "spring mechanism room" as the spring room.  The description of the Spring Room is "The machinery in here seems to be composed primarily of springs, interlocking gears, larger springs, large padded plates set up parallel to the floor, even larger springs, some sort of piston-like things, and even a few absurdly large springs.

If it is indeed similar, something this immense and elaborate would have to be a shock absorber for something like a mechanically-powered mountain."The control panel is scenery in the Spring Room. The control panel is a supporter. The description of the control panel is "[if the dial is on the control panel]The control panel features a single dial with the numbers 1 to 20.[otherwise]Inconveniently, someone seems to have partially disassembled it. You can see the places where controls are supposed to be attached (along with their labels which you can't read), but all the knobs, switches, dials and levers have been removed."Instead of inserting something (called the component) into the control panel, try putting the component on the control panel.

The metal door is east of the long corridor and west of the Small Chamber. The description of the metal door is "A solid sheet of green metal.
