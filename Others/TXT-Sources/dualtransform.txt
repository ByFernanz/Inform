When play begins:
    say "Time for a fresh start.[paragraph break]You've been slogging towards the goal -- true metasemanticity -- for months. Code-logic sparkles in your dreams and mutters in your ears. You've made great strides of progress, thrown them away, rewritten, rearranged, refactored -- but the contract deadline is crawling down your throat. No escaping that. You've got to pull this project together, and soon.[paragraph break]So forget all of the environment modelling, the texture cores, the interface splicing. You're going to build on basic physical forces. Like heat, light, maybe mass... Make it [italic type]feel[roman type] real, in the user's gut."

Chapter - Infrastructure

Use serial comma.
Use American dialect.
Use full-length room descriptions.
Use no scoring.

The verb to be equal-or-less than implies the numerically-less-than-or-equal-to relation.

Rule for deciding whether all includes scenery: it does not.

Does the player mean doing something with scenery:
    it is unlikely.
Does the player mean doing something with an icon:
    it is unlikely.

When play begins:
    now the store-count is zero;
    now the last-converted-force is void;
    now the current-duel is non-duel;
    now the right hand status line is "[if the location is ZRoom]all 7 forces[else if the location is Trapped]escape?[else if store-count is zero]a fresh start[else][store-count in words] force[s][end if]";
    now the left hand status line is "[location][if the location is ZRoom] (metasemantical)[else if the location is a force-room] ([force of the location])[end if]".

Check preferring unabbreviated room descriptions:
    say "[Story title] always gives long descriptions of your location.";
    stop the action.

Check preferring abbreviated room descriptions:
    say "[Story title] always gives long descriptions of your location.";
    stop the action.

Check preferring sometimes abbreviated room descriptions:
    say "[Story title] always gives long descriptions of your location.";
    stop the action.

The description of the player is "'T. Jant Ganzfeld is a notable contract researcher in virtual workspace design...' But you don't need to re-read your own Distribupedia article[if the location is not ZRoom]. If this project works out, it'll get a lot more impressive. If not -- goodbye to that 'notable'. And maybe that 'is', too[else]. It'll record your triumph soon enough[end if]."

To say para -- running on:
    (- DivideParagraphPoint(); new_line; -).

To say openness of (C - container):
    if C is open:
        say "open";
    else:
        say "closed".

A cycler is a kind of thing.
A stopping-cycler is a kind of cycler.
A cycler has a number called the current-count. The current-count of a cycler is usually 1.
A cycler has a number called the limit. The limit of a cycler is usually 2.

To decide what number is peek at (C - cycler):
    decide on the current-count of C.

To decide what number is current (C - cycler):
    let N be the current-count of C;
    increase the current-count of C by one;
    if the current-count of C is greater than the limit of C:
        now the current-count of C is one;
    decide on N.

To decide what number is current (C - stopping-cycler):
    let N be the current-count of C;
    increase the current-count of C by one;
    if the current-count of C is greater than the limit of C:
        now the current-count of C is the limit of C;
    decide on N.

To decide whether verb-word-read:
    (- (verb_word == 'read') -).

To say recognize (T - thing):
    now T is known.

The description of an icon is "[if the item described is stored]In the workspace is[else]It's[end if] a small symbol representing [italic type][force][roman type], in all its [aspects of force]."
An icon has a force.
An icon has a room called the domain. The domain is usually the StartRoom.

To say aspects of (F - force):
    if F is:
        -- pressure: say "aspects and implications";
        -- heat: say "ramifications and aspects";

The last-converted-force is a force that varies.
The item-in-play is a truth state that varies.
The env-counter is a number that varies.
The env-squelch is a truth state that varies.

Discover-return-shift is a truth state that varies.

    try invoking the noun.

Instead of invoking an unstored icon:
    now the noun is in the workspace;
    now the last-converted-force is the force of the noun;
    now the store-count is the number of stored icons;
    if the store-count is greater than 1:
        now the icon-group is part of the workspace;
    if the noun is the light-icon:
        now item-in-play is true;
    now the buzz-counter is zero;
    if store-count is:
        -- 1: say "You raise [the noun], consider its intricacies, and release it into the workspace. It drifts away.[para]Smoothly, elegantly, the workspace turns inside out.";
        -- 2: say "You hold [the noun] up towards the workspace and give it a gentle push. It slides neatly into place, and the world transforms around you.";
        -- 3: say "You hold [the noun] up and give it a push towards the workspace. It slides neatly into place, and the world transforms around you.";
        -- 4: say "You hold [the noun] up and push it towards the workspace. It resists for a moment, and then slides into place. The environment transforms.";
        -- 5: say "You push [the noun] towards the workspace -- but it skids to the side. You tighten your grip to try again. With some careful pressure, the icon slides into place.";
        -- 6: say "You raise [the noun], and feel the tangible resistance beating from the workspace. What a mess. You lean against it, and slowly shove the icon into its place.";
        -- 7: say "[The noun] shudders in your grip. Pushing it into the workspace is like forcing it through gravel, but you lean into the force. After several moments of struggle, the icon is in place. The world changes...";
        -- otherwise: say "(Shift to new environment, stage [store-count].)";
    shift to the domain of the noun.

Instead of invoking a stored icon:
    if the location is the domain of the noun:
        instead say "You poke [the noun], [one of]which flashes reprovingly, since[or]but[stopping] it is already active.";
    if the location is the ZRoom:
        instead say "Your collection is complete; you feel like you've done enough for the day's work.";
    say "You invoke [the noun], and the environment [one of]shifts[or]changes[or]transforms[cycling] [one of]around you[or]into a new form[cycling].";
    now discover-return-shift is true;
    shift to the domain of the noun;
    check clumsiness.

To shift to (R - room):
    now the workspace is in R;
    now the env-counter is zero;
    now the env-squelch is false;
    if item-in-play is true and the player does not carry a morph-item:
        now all morph-items are in the morph-box;
        [if R is the Cave and carried-any-morph is false:
            do nothing;
        else:]
        if a morph-item (called M) is based in R:
            now M is in R;
    if current-duel is not non-duel:
        now the current-duel is in R;
    if R is:
        -- Church:

                now the offer-box is in the Church;
        -- Longhall:
            if the offer-box is closed:
                now the chest is closed;
            else:
                now the chest is open;
        -- Cave:
            if the mushroom is not converted:
                if the player carries the torch and the torch is zlit:
                    now the mushroom is in the Cave;
                    now the mushroom is discovered;
                else if the mushroom is discovered:
                    now the mushroom is in the Cave;
                else:
                    remove the mushroom from play;
        -- Library:
            if the library is not known:
                now the library is known;
                now discovered-alt-morph is true;
                now seen-foreign-morph is true;
                now the window is in the Church;

The clumsiness-level is a number that varies.

To check clumsiness:
    if understand-drop-switch is true:
        stop;
    if the player carries a morph-item (called M):
        let do-it be false;
        if the last-converted-force is light and M is not the torch:
            now do-it is true;
        if the last-converted-force is charge and M is not the chalice:
            now do-it is true;
        if do-it is true:
            increase the clumsiness-level by 1;
            if M is based in the location:
                stop;
            if clumsiness-level is greater than 4:
                say "You are caught off-balance as the floor transforms underfoot. In the moment of flailing, your grip slips. [run paragraph on]";
                try dropping M.

The icon-group is plural-named scenery. The printed name is "icons".
Understand "icons", "symbols", "forces" as the icon-group.

Instead of examining or searching the icon-group:
    say "Within the workspace you see ";
    list the contents of the workspace, as a sentence, using the definite article;
    say icon-motion-gloss;
    if the player carries an icon (called O):
        say ". And then there is [the O] that you carry";
    say ".";

Instead of doing anything except examining, searching the icon-group:
    say "One at a time, please."

Chapter - Archetypes and Workspace

An archetype is a kind of thing.
An archetype can be known or unknown. An archetype can be converted.
An archetype has an icon called the attribute.

Understand "archetype" as an archetype when the item described is known.

Instead of taking an archetype (called A):
    if A is the book and the book is locked:
        instead say "You try to take the book. But the padlock chains it to the bookcase, and you can't compile it while it is fastened.";
    let F be the force of the attribute of A;
    now the player has the attribute of A;
    remove A from play;
    now A is converted;
    if F is pressure:
        say "You cup your hand around [the A] and compile. It shrinks obligingly into a small icon, which you take.[paragraph break]This is just what you were hoping for -- a simple principle, from which an entire immersive world can grow. Now to drop it in the workspace and see what you get.";
    else:
        if A is not known:
            now A is known;
            say "[one of]Upon closer examination, [or]It appears that [or]You look more closely and see that [cycling][the A] is an archetype: [italic type][F][roman type]. You reach out and compile; it shrinks obligingly into a small icon, which you take.";
        else:
            say "You take [the A] and compile. It shrinks obligingly into a small icon.";
    set pronouns from the attribute of A.

Instead of invoking an archetype:
    try taking the noun.

The workspace is in the StartRoom.
The workspace is a container. The workspace is scenery.
Understand "work", "space", "clear", "virtual", "cube" as the workspace.

Instead of taking or entering or invoking the workspace:
    say "You are already in your workspace. This is it. This is where you work.";
    if the Longhall is visited and discover-return-shift is false:
        say "[line break]However, you could use the icons [italic type]in[roman type] the workspace to manipulate it."

The workspace-in-dark is a stopping-cycler.

Instead of examining or searching the workspace:
    if the location is the StartRoom:
        say "You are alone in your workspace[if equation in StartRoom], except for the pressure equation[end if].";
    else:
        say "The workspace is represented by a clear, waist-high cube. Within it ";
        list the contents of the workspace, as a sentence, prefacing with is/are, using the definite article;
        say icon-motion-gloss;
        say ".";
        if the Longhall is visited and discover-return-shift is false:
            say "[line break]These icons will be useful. The transformations you have experienced can be controlled.";
        if the location is the Cave and the current workspace-in-dark is 1:
            say "[line break](Your workspace, of course, is not visually rendered. It would be visible even in total darkness.)"

To say space icon summary:
    if store-count is:
        -- 1: say " is suspended the pressure icon";
        -- 2: say " hang your two icons";
        -- 3: say " drift three icons";
        -- 4: say " move four icons";
        -- 5: say " bounce five icons";
        -- 6: say " the six icons whirl";

Chapter - The Item

A morph-item is a kind of thing.
A morph-item can be known or unknown.

Understand "tool" as a morph-item.

The morph-box is a container. All morph-items are usually in the morph-box.

Belonging relates one morph-item to one force-room. The verb to be based in implies the belonging relation.

The chalice is a morph-item. The chalice is based in the Church. The printed name is "pewter chalice".
The torch is a morph-item. The torch is based in the Longhall. The printed name is "[if zlit]flaming[else]wooden[end if] torch".
The axe is a morph-item. The axe is based in the Cave. The printed name is "rusty axe".
The compass is a morph-item. The compass is based in the Lab. The printed name is "brass compass".
The key is a morph-item. The key is based in the Library. The printed name is "silver key".
The moon is a morph-item. The moon is based in the Circle. The printed name is "moon".

After printing the name of a morph-item (called M):
    now M is known.

To say para-morph (M - morph-item):
    now M is known;
    if the first-seen-morph is nothing:
        now the first-seen-morph is M;
        [say ". That's new";]
    if the first-seen-morph is not M and discovered-alt-morph is false:
        now discovered-alt-morph is true;
        say ". [if understand-drop-switch is true]This[else]Ah -- this[end if] must be the parallel of [the first-seen-morph]"

Understand-drop-switch is a truth state that varies.
Carried-any-morph is a truth state that varies.
Seen-foreign-morph is a truth state that varies.
Discovered-alt-morph is a truth state that varies.
First-seen-morph is an object that varies. First-seen-morph is nothing.

After examining a morph-item when seen-foreign-morph is false:
    if the location is not a force-room or the noun is not based in the location:
        now seen-foreign-morph is true;
        say "[The noun] did not transform along with the environment, when you switched to [the location]. Nice touch: a tool in hand must get priority over local themes."

The dropping action has a morph-item called the drop-switch.

Setting action variables for dropping:
    now the drop-switch is nothing.

After dropping a morph-item when the location is a force-room:
    now carried-any-morph is true;
    if the noun is not based in the location:
        let M be a random morph-item based in the location;
        now the drop-switch is M;
        remove noun from play;
        now M is in the location;
    continue the action.

Report dropping when the drop-switch is not nothing:
    if the drop-switch is the moon:
        now understand-drop-switch is true;
        now seen-moon is true;
        say "As you release [the noun], it shimmers... and fades into the sky. In moments, it has become a distant circle of light: the full moon";
    else:
        if understand-drop-switch is false:
            now understand-drop-switch is true;
            say "As you release [the noun], it shimmers. You watch, fascinated, as its shape readjusts to its new environment. In moments, [the noun] has [if drop-switch is unknown]turned into[else]reverted to being[end if] [a drop-switch]";
        else:
            say "As [the noun] leaves your grasp, it [if drop-switch is unknown]shimmers and transforms into[else]reverts to being[end if] [a drop-switch]";
    set pronouns from drop-switch;
    if the location is the Cave and the noun is the torch and the torch is zlit:
        say ". Your eyes slowly adjust to the near-complete darkness";
    instead say "."

After taking a morph-item:
    now carried-any-morph is true;
    continue the action.


Understand "pewter", "rough", "cup" as the chalice.
