Chapter 1- Mechanics and framework

Section 1-Credits, help, scoring, etc

Understand "walkthrough" as asking for walkthrough.
Asking for walkthrough is an action out of world.
Carry out asking for walkthrough:
	say "Move north towards the ice. Objects move up and down a bit at first, so don't go down yet.
	
	Take the ice. Go south as far as you can without dying until it melts.
	
	Go to the scroll. Take it, go west, and read it.
	
	Grab one of the two objects. They are both moving nonstop, so go above or below them and wait. If they go off the edge of the world, they will reappear beneath their old position.
	
	Once you have one object, chase the creatures that appears using diagonal directions (i.e. NEU, SU, etc.).
	
	Now you have a choice. I recommend grabbing the vacuum flask, travelling down until it explodes, then waiting for all the others to come to you. Take the chest and go east until it breaks. Then wait till the others come, grab them one at a time, and crush them one at a time.
	
	Now, simply rocket west twice.
	
	Wait until the heart appears. Crush the heart.
	
	Try to grab a bubble or two. It's okay if you don't.
	
	Wait until the sphere appears. Take it.[paragraph break]
	"

Understand "about" or "help" or "hint" or "hints" as asking for help.
Asking for help is an action out of world.
Carry out asking for help:
	say "[bold type]Commands[roman type]: If you are new to interactive fiction, you can type COMMANDS to get a list of all the commands necessary to complete this game, and instructions on how to use them. Commands that you can type in are written in caps throughout this documentation.
	
	[bold type]Movement[roman type]: 'Ether' is mostly set in one very large area (with many small sub-areas) where your location determines the properties of the environment. Going UP and DOWN increases or decreases the pressure, going EAST and WEST increases and decreases wind speed, and going NORTH and SOUTH makes you colder or hotter. Each variable has levels 0 to 8. Going beyond the highest and lowest levels always results in death.

	You can use alternative directions. For instance, COLDER or C will go north; HOTTER or H is south; FIERCER or F is east; MILDER or M is west; THINNER or T is up; and DENSER or D is down.
	
	You can also combine directions: NU, UN, or NORTHUP will take you north and up. SWD, WDS, WSD, SDW, DWS, or DSW will take you south, west, and down (the parser can't handle words as big as SOUTHWESTDOWN).

	Finally, you can alway just use GO TO [bracket]something[close bracket] to have your character move in the direction of the item.

	[bold type]Precision[roman type]: If you want the exact ('quantitative') number of moves necessary to reach an item, type 'QUANT ON'. To stop, type 'QUANT OFF'.
	
	[bold type]Walkthrough[roman type]: For a walkthrough, type 'WALKTHROUGH'.
	
	[bold type]Credits[roman type]: For credits, type 'CREDITS'.[paragraph break]

Understand "commands" or "command" or "list commands" as commanding. Commanding is an action out of world.

Understand "who" or "what" or "when" or "where" or "why" or "how" or "who's" or "what's" or "when's" or "where's" or "why's" or "how's" as "[query]". 

Understand "[query] [text]" or "[query]" as a mistake ("[story title] understands commands, such as 'GO NORTH', but not questions. For more instructions, type COMMANDS."). 

Carry out commanding:
	say "This game uses a parser, which means that you type in what you want the game to do whenever you see the symbol '>'. The game has a limited vocabulary, usually limited to 2-4 words at a time.
	
	The most important commands in this game are the directional commands. For instance, to go north, you can type GO NORTH. To save time, you can just type NORTH, or, even better, just N. Interactive fiction traditionally allows movement in 10 directions: N, E, S, W, NE, SE, SW, NW, U (for UP) and D (for DOWN).  In the opening scene of 'Ether', you can try typing 'N' until the game says you are next to the ice.
	
	(Advanced) 'Ether' also allows any combination of these directions, such as NEU, SED, ND, as long as you don't put in conflicting directions (such as UD).
	
	The other most important commands are:
	
	LOOK (abbreviated L), which reprints the description of the region you are in, and tells you what important things are in it;
	
	LOOK AT [bracket]SOMETHING[close bracket] (or EXAMINE, abbreviated X), which lets you look more closely at a specific object. For example, in the first scene of 'Ether', you can type X ICE to get a better look at the ice.
	
	TAKE [bracket]SOMETHING[close bracket] , which lets you pick something up. In 'Ether', you can only pick up items that you are close to (if you are close enough to take something, the game will tell you that it is right next to you). In 'Ether', you can try TAKE ICE once you are close enough to it.
	
	INVENTORY (abbreviated I) tells you what you are carrying. The term comes from older games such as Dungeons and Dragons.
	
	DROP [bracket]SOMETHING[close bracket] lets you stop carrying something. You can try dropping the ice if you still have it by typing DROP ICE, and then pick it up again by typing TAKE ICE.
	
	UNDO lets you take back your last action. Trying typing 'N' until you freeze to death, then type UNDO to go back to before you died.
	
	SAVE lets you save your game if you have to stop. RESTORE lets you resume your game. If you are playing the game on Parchment or the IFComp website, the command SAVE changes the web address of the game, so that you can bookmark it. If you return to that address and type RESTORE, you can retrieve your game.
	
	QUANT ON is a command unique to this game that allows you to find out exactly how far away you are from different objects and from the edges of the world. QUANT OFF removes this data.
	
	WALKTHROUGH provides a complete walkthrough.
	
	CREDITS gives the credits of the game, including beta testers and the inspiration for different concepts, as well as the credits of the cover art.
	
	Good luck! If this message was too long for your screen try scrolling upwards to see the rest of it."

Understand "quant on" as quanting on. Understand "quant off" as quanting off. Quanting on is an action out of world. Quanting off is an action out of world.

QuantOnOff is a number that varies. QuantOnOff is 0.

Carry out quanting on:
	say "A grid of thin red lines overlays your vision. Numbers appear giving your wind speed, temperature, and pressure. All objects appear with numbers attached to them as well.[paragraph break]";
	Now QuantOnOff is 1;
	Silently try looking;

Carry out quanting off:
	if QuantOnOff is 1:
		say "The grid and the numbers disappear.[paragraph break]";
		Now QuantOnOff is 0;
		Silently try looking;
	otherwise:
		say "Precise numbers are already off.";

The grid is part of the player. The description of the grid is "[if QuantOnOff is 1]A grid of thin red lines that allows you to precisely pinpoint the location of all objects in this world.[otherwise]Your grid is not currently enabled.[end if]";

NumChecking is an action applying to nothing. Understand "x numbers" or "examine numbers" or "look at numbers" as NumChecking.

Carry out NumChecking:
	say "[if QuantOnOff is 1]Floating numbers in the red grid indicate the distance of various objects, as well as the temperature, windspeed, and air pressure.[otherwise]You currently don't have your grid enabled.[end if]";

[Hard puzzles here; lightdark kills you]
Understand "hard puzzles" as difficulting on. Understand "hard puzzles off" as difficulting off. Difficulting on is an action out of world. Difficulting off is an action out of world.

HardOnOff is a number that varies. HardOnOff is 0.

Carry out difficulting on:
	say "Hard puzzles are on";
	Now HardOnOff is 1.

Carry out difficulting off:
	say "Hard puzzles are off";
	Now HardOnOff is 0.

Understand "credits" or "info" as asking for credits.
Asking for credits is an action out of world.
Carry out asking for credits:
say "'Ether' is written by Brian Rushton under the name Mathbrush. 

Inform 7 is the work of Graham Nelson.

Nick Turner, Bora Bosna, Adri, Arthur O'Dwyer, DJ Hastings, Andrew Schultz, Dirk Straube, Hugo Labrande and Sean M. Shore provided extremely helpful feedback as testers, leading to large changes in the text and in puzzle design. Any remaining errors or other issues with the game are the sole responsibility of the author.

Daniel Stelzer and David White offered feedback on my earlier attempts at games, which greatly affected this game.

The cover art is Nautilus Palau by Manuae - Own work. Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 via Wikimedia Commons - https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nautilus_Palau.JPG#/media/File:Nautilus_Palau.JPG .

The quotation is from 'The Chambered Nautilus', a poem by Oliver Wendell Holmes. I discovered it after the entire game was written. (This quotation does not appear when using Parchment). I have reproduced it here:

Year after year beheld the silent toil[line break] 
That spread his lustrous coil;[line break]	 
Still, as the spiral grew,[line break] 
He left the past year's dwelling for the new,[line break]
Stole with soft step its shining archway through,[line break]
Built up its idle door,[line break]
Stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more.[line break]
[line break]
--From 'The Chambered Nautilus', by Oliver Wendell Homes

I first saw a cubical navigation system in Emily Short's 'Aspel'. The physics mechanics of the game were inspired by Andrew Plotkin's 'Dual Transform' and Emily Short's 'Metamorphoses'. Sean M. Shore suggested that the objects interact with each other. The four powers, which can be obtained in any order, was an idea from Mega Man. The eye boss was inspired by the wall boss in Secret of Mana 2. Andrew Schultz helped with the diagonal directions.

The idea of a Nautilus protagonist came from a visit to a paleontology museum, where they had several Ammonoid fossils; followed by watching the eleventh episode of the documentary 'Planet Earth'. My wife offered a great deal of support for me making this game, my first ever.

The author is not the Brian Rushton with the blog 'Plasmic Ramblings of Brian Rushton', although he is very nice and writes fiction."

Section 4-Physical Objects 

A physical is a kind of thing. A physical has a number called the density. The density is usually 0. A physical has numbers called xcord, ycord, and zcord. [Used for meltable items] A physical has a number called the melting score. The melting score is usually 7.

Check taking a physical:
	if xcord of the noun is not northness:
		say "That's too far away!" instead;
	otherwise if ycord of the noun is not eastness:
		say "That's too far away!" instead;
	otherwise if zcord of the noun is not upness:
		say "That's too far away!" instead;

Check touching a physical:
	if xcord of the noun is not northness:
		say "That's too far away!" instead;
	otherwise if ycord of the noun is not eastness:
		say "That's too far away!" instead;
	otherwise if zcord of the noun is not upness:
		say "That's too far away!" instead;

Section 5-Meltable objects

A physical can be meltable or not meltable. 

[Deal with objects melting. Objects melt faster the further south they are. 20 is frozen solid, 0 is melted]
Every turn:
	repeat with current running through meltable physicals that are not nowhere:
		now melting score of current is melting score of current plus xcord of current;
		if melting score of current is greater than 7:
			now melting score of current is 7;
		otherwise if melting score of current is less than 1:
			say "The [current] has now melted completely.[paragraph break]";
			now current is nowhere;
			increase the score by one;
		otherwise if xcord of current is greater than 0:
			say "The [current] is becoming more frozen.[paragraph break]";
		otherwise if xcord of current is less than 0:
			say "The [current] is melting[if xcord of current is minus one] slowly.[otherwise if xcord of current is less than minus one] rapidly.[paragraph break][end if]";

After examining a meltable object:
	if melting score of the noun is less than 7:
		say "The [noun] is partially melted.";
	otherwise:
		say "The [noun] is frozen solid."

Section 1-Quotation

When play begins:

		That spread his lustrous coil;[line break]
		Still, as the spiral grew,[line break]
		He left the past year's dwelling for the new,[line break] 
		Stole with soft step its shining archway through,[line break]
		Built up its idle door,[line break]
		Stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more.'[line break]
		
		--From 'The Chambered Nautilus', by Oliver Wendell Homes[variable letter spacing][paragraph break]";
	say "For the first time in centuries, something is different. Your tentacles tingle as you float to the east past icebergs and whirlwinds. You skirt a pocket of hot air, bounce through a field of ice, and finally come upon a massive stormcloud filling the sky to the east. 
	
	There it is. Glinting red below you and heading this way.[paragraph break]";

Section 2-Magic ice

The chunk of red ice is a meltable physical. Understand "crystal" or "power" or "magical" or "pulsing" as chunk of red ice. Understand "frozen" as chunk of red ice. The description of the ice is "A small chunk of cold red ice pulsing with magical power.[first time] You remember...[paragraph break]You were new to this world, and its strong winds and extreme environment frightened you at first. You felt out of control and lost. You thought of leaving, of giving up, of admitting you had made a mistake. You even began preparing the great door to your next home. [paragraph break]But you changed your mind at the last minute. You would make a home here, and you would not leave until you mastered this realm. So you took the power, the world-power, the summoning-power, the mind-power, and bound it in this crystal until it was time.[paragraph break]But the time is now.[only]". The xcord of ice is 4. The ycord of ice is 0. The zcord of ice is -4. The ice is in aloft.

Understand "chunk" as red ice. Understand "magic" or "crystal" as red ice. 

Instead of touching the red ice:
	say "A cold, hard chunk of ice.[if melting score of ice is less than 7] It is melting.[end if]"
	
After taking the red ice for the first time:

 "Standard responses"	 --	 "Did you try... Wiggling? Kissing yourself? Smelling yourself? Listening? Waking up? Anything else?"	 --
 "Alternate solutions"	 --	 "Did you try... finding both ways of opening the eye? Both ways of crushing the heart?"	 --
 "Unusual deaths"	 --	 "Did you try... becoming a diamond? Taking too long to open the eye?"	 --
 "Nautilus trivia"	 --	 "I discovered after writing this game that other IF games have used nautiluses. In particular, the world in Ryan Veeder's Nautilisia is shaped like one.[paragraph break]According to Wikipedia, nautiluses actually have very strong tentacles, unlike our protagonist. Also, they can in fact 'smell' using rhinophores, an external sensory organ. They move with jet propulsion and can change their buoyancy."	 --

  Sails the unshadowed main,[line break]
  The venturous bark that flings[line break]
On the sweet summer wind its purpled wings[line break]

  Still, as the spiral grew,[line break]

Stole with soft step its shining archway through,[line break]
  Built up its idle door,[line break]
Stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more.[line break][paragraph break]
Thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee,[line break]
  Child of the wandering sea,[line break]
  Cast from her lap, forlorn![line break]
From thy dead lips a clearer note is born[line break]
Than ever Triton blew from wreathd horn![line break]
  While on mine ear it rings,[line break]

Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,[line break]
