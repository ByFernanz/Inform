The story description is "In the beginning was the Word, and it was hungry. Enter a steampunk adventure set in a London that might have been. The year is 1885. Bedlam Hospital still stands in Moorsfield, a decaying shell used to house the poor and the hopeless. Steam-driven mechanical wonders roam the streets. Gear-wheeled analytical engines spin out reams of thought onto punched paper tapes. And in the darkness - in the alleys and the side shops - hide secrets. A ten-year anniversary reimplementation/rerelease of the original 2003 story."
The story creation year is 2013.
The release number is 2.

Table of Phonograph Hints
hint	used
"Doesn't look like the kind that plays flat disk-shaped records, does it?"
"You can ask Triage to analyze it, if you like."
"It's a personal recording device that plays tin cylinders."
"You can TURN OFF the phonograph, TAKE the particular cylinder within it (or simply OPEN it to remove it), and PUT a new one in. Then TURN ON the phonograph again."
"The command 'play [bracket]date of cylinder[close bracket]' also works."

"Specifically, a screen, a set of wheels, and a large emerald."
"Have you examined the desk thoroughly?"
"Have you read the manual?"
"'...the mechanical assistant left by my predecessor...'"
"The cube is a Triage series personal analytical engine."
"You can start it up by pushing the emerald."
"As the manual says, it will now follow you around of its own accord."
"If you wish to analyze anything or check the machine's database, simply POINT or GESTURE to the object of your query. Triage will take care of the rest."

Table of Paper Hints

"Sometimes appearances can be deceiving."
"Not this time, however. They're meaningless."

"Even then - there are thousands of drawers and who knows how many files. How on earth would you even know where to begin looking?"
"Perhaps someone can help you?"
"Perhaps someTHING can help you?"
"'...the thing seems filled with information regarding the hospital down the point of minutiae...'"

"How can you get the pedestal to retrieve something for you?"
"The pedestal also contains a dial - which can be turned to any number between 1 and 9 and any letter between A and F."
"Try fiddling with the dial."
"Try turning the dial to various positions until 6 symbols are shown on the tape."
"So the files are organized by a 6-character name or code."
"If you happen to find one of those codes, try entering it into the pedestal via the dial."

Table of File Number Hints
hint	used
"James might know."
"Or perhaps not. That'd be a very large list, and it would be difficult to search through."
"He might mention that specific numbers of current cases are stored in the Panopticon."
"Off to the Panopticon, then. It's the Circular Chamber west of the Walkway."
"Examine the Panopticon controls. Notice anything familiar?"
"That button with the inverted triangle looks familiar, though the lines extending from it might be confusing."
"Get the Panopticon running, view a room and try pushing the button."
"If nothing happens, that probably means there's not a patient associated with that room."
"Check the hints under the Panopticon for finding the important rooms."

"'...it would accept a long, flanged key...'"
"Have you seen a key like that?"
"Try the drawer in the Office."
"Well, now it's activated and the room has changed 'subtly'."
"Try 'look' after putting the key in the keyhole. The exit's changed."

Table of Panopticon Rooms Hints
hint	used
"Many of the rooms are completely unusable -- they're either structurally unsound or have literally collapsed."
"Three of the rooms are safe enough to enter -- A, C, and D."
"Only one of these seems to have been used recently -- D."
"Several of the rooms will produce file-codes when the triangular button is pressed -- specifically C, D, and E."
"It depends on your definition of important."
"Entering the code produced by Room 6D into the Archives will reveal that Cleve Anderson was kept there until recently."

Table of Corridor 6 Room D Hints
hint	used
"There's definitely an intention to it -- the markings are carved very precisely."
"It's broken up into several sections -- the string of text at the center ('ZXWHT...'), the lines which surround it, and the other text ('LOGOS EN SOPH...')."
"There's a lot of information here. And you might not have enough of a background to interpret it."
"The [']further text['] seems at least to be written in some form of language, the center text looks like nonsense..."
"...or encrypted. It's a code."
"This puzzle *is* solvable, but it would require outside information. If you don't recognize the words NOTARIKON, GEMATRIA, or TEMURAH or you don't understand what the other text is doing, you probably wouldn't be able to do so."
"That's alright though, you have someone who's very good at analyzing things and '...connecting seemingly disparate data into a coherent whole...'"
"SomeTHING, rather..."
"Triage."
"POINT AT THE WALL when Triage is present. It'll be tough for it, but its final screen of information will be the solution to the cypher at the center..."
"'Malkuth is in Kether as Kether is in Malkuth.'"
"Or, in Triage's interpretation: '[bracket]Man[close bracket] is in [bracket]God[close bracket] as [bracket]God[close bracket] is in [bracket]Man[close bracket].'"
"If that doesn't mean anything to you now, don't worry. It might somewhere down the road."

Chapter 3 - Opening

When play begins, say "*clunk*[paragraph break]The rotating tin cylinder within the phonograph vibrates slightly as a brass needle scrapes against it. The sound of a throat being cleared emerges from the machine's hornshell speaker, followed by a thin, haunting voice.[paragraph break][entry 1 of the media of the March sixteenth cylinder][line break]"

Chapter 4 - Analysis

[This code gives analytical information for Triage to work with]

All things have some text called analysis. The analysis is usually "CAT:UNKNOWN/UNLI[line break]STED.UTIL:NOT.AP[line break]PLICABLE.PART:NO[line break]NE.ITEM.IS.NOT.R[line break]ECOGNIZED.BY.CUR[line break]RENT.SYSTEM.STOR[line break]E.REQUIRE.ADDITI[line break]ONAL.INFORMATION".

Pointing at is an action applying to one visible thing and requiring light.  Understand "point at [something]" or "point to [something]" or "point towards [something]" as pointing at.   Understand "gesture at [something]" or "gesture to [something]" or "gesture towards [something]" as pointing at.

Check pointing at: if Triage is not visible, say "Nothing happens." Check pointing at: if Triage is visible and the emerald is not switched on, say "Nothing happens."

The analysis of the player is "CAT:LIVING......[line break]*CATASTROPHIC.ER[line break]RROR.A042.CATEGO[line break]RY.INDEX.OUT.OF.[line break]RANGE.STACK.OVER[line break]FLOW*PART:ID=DR.[line break]THOMAS.XAVIER=CU[line break]RRENT.OPERATOR..".

[It's probably more elegant to have all objects have an analyzed/initial analysis, but the only special case is Cleve's writing...]
Instead of pointing at something when Triage is visible and the emerald is switched on:
	say "[if the noun is the player]The emerald flickers from head to toe before returning:[otherwise][one of]The emerald eye examines [the noun] returning with:[or]A small beam of green light lashes out over [the noun] as Triage's screen lights up:[or]Triage's emerald searches [the noun], then... [or]The machine analyzes [the noun] before replying... [or]Triage's beam flickers over [the noun], briefly, then displays:[at random][end if][paragraph break]";
	if the noun is the writing and the analyzed of the writing is false:
		now the analyzed of the writing is true;
		say "[the initial analysis of the writing][line break]";
	otherwise:
		now the current display of the screen is the analysis of the noun;
		say "[fixed letter spacing][the current display of the screen][variable letter spacing][line break]".;
		if the noun is Du Monde and Du Monde is alive:
			say "[line break]Du Monde's throat tightens slightly. 'How clever,' she whispers.";
		otherwise if the noun is the puzzle box and the analyzed of the writing is true:
			say "[line break]The mechanism clatters for a moment, making connections, then...[paragraph break][fixed letter spacing]SEPHIROTH+KABBAL[line break]AH+MACHINE=CYPHE[line break]RIST.!.POSSIBLE.[line break]CONNECTION.CYPHE[line break]R='MALKUTH.IS.IN[line break]KETHER'-SOLUTION[line break]=MALKUTH,KETHER,[line break]KETHER,MALKUTH?![variable letter spacing][line break]";
		otherwise if the noun is the pin:
			if Du Monde is alive:
				say "[line break]Her eyes harden, although her smile never wavers.[paragraph break]'A trifle, I assure you.

Chapter 5 - Epidemiology and Endings

[This code follows the proliforation of the Logos. With Cleve gone, at the beginning of the game only Xavier is infected.]

A person can be infected or not infected. A person is usually not infected. The player is infected.
A person can be alive or dead. A person is usually alive.
A person can be a carrier or not a carrier.
Definition: a person is a carrier if they are alive, and they are infected.
Definition: a person is not a carrier if dead.

Instead of searching a person when the noun is dead, say "Nothing of interest is to be found on the body."
Instead of doing something other than examining or searching or pointing at to a person when the noun is dead, say "A difficult and futile task."

Chapter 6 - Cylinders

A cylinder is a kind of thing. The description of a cylinder is usually "A small, labeled tin cylinder approximately a handsbreadth wide, its surface is inscribed with a fine groove which winds down its entire length." The analysis of a cylinder is usually "CAT:NONLIVING.TO[line break]OL.UTIL:RECORDIN[line break]G.MEDIUM.FOR.COR[line break]RECTLY.OUTFITTED[line break]PHONOGRAPH.PART:[line break]RECORDED.AUDIO.D[line break]IARY.ENTRY=PLAY.[line break]IN.PHONOGRAPH...". A cylinder has a list of texts called the media. The media is usually {"***ERROR: EMPTY CYLINDER***"}.

[Using "the playback activity" to keep track and not display certain 'After' functionality...]

Playing is an action applying to one visible thing and requiring light.  Understand "play [something]" as playing. 
Playback is an activity.
Check playing: if the noun is not a cylinder, say "That cannot be played."
Check playing: if the phonograph is not visible, say "The cylinder requires a phonograph to be played."
Carry out playing:
	if the noun is held by the ivory arms:
		if the phonograph is switched on, say "The cylinder is already playing.";
		otherwise try switching on the phonograph;
	otherwise:
		begin the playback activity; 
		now the noun is held by the player;
		try inserting the noun into the ivory arms;
		now the current entry of the phonograph is 0;
		now the phonograph is switched on;		
		say "Nestled carefully into the phonograph[']s waiting ivory arms, the [noun] begins to play.";
		end the playback activity;

Chapter 7 - Tapes and Files

A tape is a kind of thing. A tape has an indexed text called a code. A tape has a truth state called dispensed. The dispensed of a tape is usually false. The description usually is "A short piece of paper tape, mechanically imprinted with the symbols '[the code of the noun]'."

A paper tape labeled 4361A2 is a tape. The code of a paper tape labeled 4361A2 is "4361A2".
A paper tape labeled F6A142 is a tape. The code of a paper tape labeled F6A142 is "F6A142".
A paper tape labeled DB9E75 is a tape. The code of a paper tape labeled DB9E75 is "D89E75".

A file is a kind of thing. A file is usually proper-named. A file has an indexed text called a code. A code is usually "ERROR!". 

Understand "folder" as a file.

A file labeled 4361A2 is a file. The printed name of 4361A2 is "File 4361A2: Emanuel Barthelemy". The code of 4361A2 is "4361A2". 
Instead of examining the 4361A2, say "The file is fairly brief -- it only covers the single night that Emanuel Barthelemy spent at the Hospital. The papers are written up by Dr. Simon Brand, and apparently there's been a mix-up in the system, as Barthelemy is listed as being kept in the *lower* rather than the upper Corridor 6 -- room C specifically.[paragraph break]Barthelemy was being held under suspicion of the murder of two men -- Collard and Moore -- which occurred in Warren Street, Fitzroy-Square. The case is listed as [']customary['] - Barthelemy being held under observation for 24 hours to prove or disprove his insanity.[paragraph break]Brand's final conclusion is that Emanuel is fit to stand trial.";

A file labeled F6A142 is a file. The printed name of F6A142 is "File F6A142: Cleve Anderson". The code of F6A142 is "F6A142". The F6A142 has a truth state called used. The used of the F6A142 is false. 
Instead of examining the F6A142:
	now the current menu is Table of File F6A142;
	now the current menu title is "File F6A142: Cleve Anderson";
	now the introduction boolean is 1;
	now the second introduction boolean is 1;
	now the second introduction index is 4;
	now the current menu introduction is "The file is broken into several sections:";
	now the current second menu introduction is "Personal Notes";
	carry out the displaying activity;
	clear the screen;
	now the introduction boolean is 0;
	now the second introduction boolean is 0;
	try looking;
	if the used of the F6A142 is false:
		say "As the file is closed, something nestled within its pages falls to the floor with a loud clang.[paragraph break]";
		now the iron key is in the location of the player;
		now the used of the F6A142 is true.
		
A file labeled DB9E75 is a file. The printed name of DB9E75 is "File DB9E75: Daniel McNaughton". The code of DB9E75 is "DB9E75".
Instead of examining the DB9E75, say "The file is extensive -- covering the ten years Daniel McNaughton was in residence at Bethlehem before his death two years ago. Apparently he was kept in upper-6-E for the first year, then moved to Corridor 22 for the remainder.[paragraph break]McNaughton was arrested for the attempted assassination of Prime Minister Peel and the death of Drummond (Peel[']s private secretary). McNaughton's defense stated that he was under the delusion of being persecuted by the Tories in his native Glasgow who, he claimed, 'compelled him' to act.[paragraph break]The case, of course, became the first famous legal test for acquittal by reason of insanity. Victoria's response was to order the court to develop a stricter test for insanity - which lead to the now-standing 'McNaughton Rule.'[paragraph break]Most of the later notes are by Superintendent Simon Brand - soliloquies on the McNaughton Rule and its effects on both the legal system and the psychological profession.";

The iron key is a thing. The printed name of the iron key is "large iron key". The description of the iron key is "An old-fashion rusted iron key."

Chapter 8 - Lipogram and Logos

Section 1 - Lipogram

[Removing the word "you" as much as possible from the game.]

The description of the player is "That's rather difficult without a mirror."
Instead of going nowhere, say "No exit lies in that direction." 

Instead of taking inventory: 
	if the number of things enclosed by the player is 0, say "Carried: [line break] nothing at the moment[paragraph break]" instead; 
	say "Carried: [line break]"; 
	list the contents of the player, with newlines, indented, giving inventory information, including contents, with extra indentation. 

Instead of attacking something:
	if the noun is the player:
		say "How, precisely?";
	otherwise:
		say "That particular item does not respond to violence.";

After opening a container:
	say "The [noun] opens, revealing ";
	list the contents of the noun, as a sentence, tersely, not listing concealed items;
	say ".";
After closing a container:
	say "The [noun] closes.";	

[To hide doors in descriptions.]	
Doors are usually scenery.

Section 2 - Logos

[The Logos waits 25 turns (grouped in groups of 5 turns) before stopping the player and ending the game...]
[Modified -- the list of text is now reply rather than 'response', as the latter as of 6L02 has a very specific meaning.]

The Logos is a thing. [Indeed!] The Logos has a number called counted deaths. The counted deaths of the Logos is 0. The Logos has a list of texts called the reply. The reply of the Logos is {"[bold type]/(?whygonemissingpartwholesilenceself?)\[roman type][paragraph break]The cold creeps a little further.", "[bold type]/(ceaseexistancenonullgonehowwhy)\[roman type][paragraph break]The cold has teeth now.

To spur on the Logos:
	if the counted deaths of the Logos is 0:
		say "[bold type]/(!NO!)\[roman type][line break]";
		the Logos wakes in five turns from now;
	otherwise:
		say "With another death, the cold begins to spread even faster...";

	if the reply of the Logos is empty:
		if there is exactly one person who is a carrier: [the player]

The system is constantly aware of both its personal environment and the actions of its operator.[paragraph break]Once TRIAGE has locked on to its user, operation is simply a matter of making the system aware of particular subjects in the environment for analysis and storage. This can be accomplished by simply POINTING or GESTURING to the object in question.[paragraph break]Nothing more is necessary. The system will reply (via its kinograph display) of any pertinent data the operator might find of use.[paragraph break]Triage store data is organized as follows:[paragraph break]- CAT [bracket]category[close bracket]: Triage maintains a strict hierarchy within which all subjects are stored - is the object in question alive?

Again, I am uncertain what this represents. Possibility - the patient has associated some action/event that took place in his life concurrent with the onset of glossolalia.[paragraph break]- Patient claims the change has caused time to become distorted for him - it is not a linear thing. This may be an metaphor for the internal mental confusion of which the patient's inability to communicate is a symptom.[paragraph break]- Patient refuses to discuss or even think on the infection - what it is, where it came from, if it may be catching. When confronted, patient cuts off all communication entering a semi-comatose state, often shaking the head spastically.[paragraph break]Possible conclusion:[line break]The patient believes that his glossolalia is infectious and will spread if he speaks. This may be the key to his eventual recovery. Perhaps by confronting him with a cognitive dissonance - specifically showing him that my listening to him has not [']infected['] me - he can begin to tear down the walls he has built about himself."	--
"-[bracket]March 8th, addendum[close bracket]"	--	"[fixed letter spacing][bold type][bracket]night[close bracket][roman type][variable letter spacing][line break]Witnessed patient's babbling and spastic movements again -- possibility they may be connected. Patient's speech definitely has a pattern about it which encourages listener's attention and conscious attempt to find meaning. I have decided to attempt a direct intervention/confrontation with the patient tomorrow.[paragraph break]On a personal note: I must start taking James['] advice and cut down my hours - while observing the patient I noticed that my vision blurred and I experienced a distinct dizziness. When I shook it off I found that I must have fallen asleep at some point - I checked the time, found that several hours had passed."	--
"-[bracket]March 9th[close bracket]"	--	"This will be this case's final note.[paragraph break]One would have thought I would have learned. Everything has told me one thing and I have thought another - my hubris is such as to put whatever Cleve thought he ever did to shame.[paragraph break]Cleve is dead.[paragraph break]Too far, too soon. My initial confrontation accomplished nothing - he refused again to speak of the infection and my interpretation of it. He almost laughed when I told him my theory of glossolalia - writing back that he was quite aware of what it was and that no - that was not his problem.[paragraph break]I think that what I did next was out of anger.[paragraph break]When I told him about my nightly observations, he was clearly confused - said that he knew that no one had entered the chamber while he slept - that he had checked over several of his [']saved['] times. Which is when I explained the Panopticon to him, and pointed out the listening tube hidden in the corner of his cell.[paragraph break]All of the blood drained from his face and he once again entered his catatonic state, though this time with much more vehemence. He spasmed and shook.[paragraph break]It took a long moment before I realized what was different.[paragraph break]He was *speaking* - a single word, yes - but speaking nonetheless. All he said was [']no,['] again and again in a constant stream.[paragraph break]He looked up as he realized what he was doing and yet he didn't stop for a moment. He clawed at his mouth, bit until it bled, but the word kept coming.[paragraph break]And then it contorted in his throat into a snarl as he leapt at me.[paragraph break]I am a fool. I had thought him nonviolent, and more - he was still weak, tired. Of course, I'd never had an orderly there with me, for fear of discovery, but I'd never bothered with any restraint whatsoever.[paragraph break]Though weak, he was far stronger than he looked. We struggled as I attempted to force myself towards the door and help. I slipped from his grasp and was almost away when he leapt upon me again. I pushed back, kicked with all my might...[paragraph break]I didn't understand the sound I heard until I turned around.[paragraph break]He didn't stand a chance - his head had hit the side of the metal door with such force that half his brains must have spilled out in a moment. The flicker of life in his eyes continued only for a moment as I dropped to my knees beside him.[paragraph break]He only managed to say one thing -- [']too late['] -- before it went out forever, leaving a look of horror -- and oddly pity -- on his face.[paragraph break]I write this now, and will seal up the file in the archives in some half-hearted penance, such as Cleve sought here. If sometime in the future my sins find me out, then I shall pay for them then. For now, I simply wish to forget all of it..."	--

South of Office is Lobby. East of Lobby is Archives. West of Lobby is West_Walkway. South of Lobby is Courtyard. West of West_Walkway is Circular Chamber. North of Circular Chamber is North_Walkway. North of North_Walkway is Corridor 6.  Northeast of Corridor 6 is Room 6A. East of Corridor 6 is Room 6B. Southeast of Corridor 6 is Room 6C. Southwest of Corridor 6 is Room 6D. West of Corridor 6 is Room 6E. Northwest of Corridor 6 is Room 6F.

Section 1 - Office

Office is a room. "A massive cedar desk, well-polished and worn, looks elegantly out-of-place among the chaos. Papers, files, and books cover nearly every flat surface in the room." 

Section 1(a) - Phonograph

A phonograph is fixed in place in the Office. "There is a phonograph on the table near the window." The phonograph is a device. The ivory arms are a container that are part of the phonograph. The phonograph is switched on. The analysis of the phonograph is "CAT:NONLIVING.TO[line break]OL.UTIL:RECORDIN[line break]G.AND.PLAYBACK.O[line break]F.AUDIO.INFO.PAR[line break]T:PERSONAL.PROPE[line break]RTY.OF.OPERATOR.[line break]USED.FOR.DIARY.E[line break]NTRY.RETRIEVAL..". Understand "switch" as the phonograph. The phonograph has a number called the current entry. The current entry is 1.
Instead of examining the phonograph:
	say "A delicate device, its base is carved from oaken heartwood, bearing a small black plaque which reads 'Columbia Phonograph Co., Ltd. of London'.[paragraph break]";
	if the ivory arms contain a cylinder:
		say "Two ivory arms emerging from the base lean inward, firmly grasping a [if the phonograph is switched on]rotating [end if][printed name of a random cylinder which is held by the ivory arms]. A brass needle [if the phonograph is switched on]scrapes against[otherwise]hovers above[end if] the cylinder's surface.[paragraph break]";
	otherwise:
		say "Two ivory arms emerging from the base stretch quiescently outward, as if waiting to be filled.[paragraph break]";
	say "From the base's back emerges a small, black hornshell speaker, its surface delicately curved. The phonograph is currently switched [if the phonograph is switched on]on.[otherwise]off.";	
Instead of inserting anything into the phonograph: try inserting the noun into the ivory arms.
Before inserting a cylinder into the ivory arms: 
	if there is a cylinder in the ivory arms:
		say "(first removing the cylinder already in the phonograph)";	
		try removing a random cylinder which is held by the ivory arms from the ivory arms;
After inserting a cylinder into the ivory arms: if not handling the playback activity, say "The [noun] fits perfectly into the phonograph's waiting ivory arms."	
Instead of inserting anything that is not a cylinder into the ivory arms: say "The phonograph is designed to play inscribed tin cylinders."
Before taking a cylinder which is in the ivory arms:
	if the phonograph is switched on:
		say "(first switching off the phonograph)";
		try switching off the phonograph.
Instead of taking a cylinder which is in the ivory arms:
	now the noun is carried by the player;
	say "The ivory arms slide easily apart and the cylinder leaves the phonograph with a slight 'click'."
Instead of opening the ivory arms:
	if the number of things enclosed by the ivory arms is 0:
		say "The arms of the phonograph are already open and empty.";
	otherwise:
		try removing a random cylinder which is held by the ivory arms from the ivory arms;

Every turn:
	if the phonograph is switched on:
		increase the current entry of the phonograph by 1;
		let position be the current entry of the phonograph;
		let the current cylinder be a random cylinder inside the ivory arms;
		if position is at most the number of entries in the media of the current cylinder:
			if the player is in the Office:
				say "[entry position of the media of the current cylinder][line break]";
		otherwise:
			now the current entry of the phonograph is 0;
			now the phonograph is switched off;
			if the player is in the Office, say "Having reached the end of the cylinder, the phonograph shuts itself off with a tiny 'click'.";

The tin cylinder labeled March sixteenth is a cylinder. The March sixteenth cylinder is in the ivory arms. The media of the March sixteenth cylinder is {"'March the 16th.'[paragraph break]A deep, shaky breath.[paragraph break]'I dread to say it, but I believe I am going mad. The -- *moments* -- come more frequently now. I fear that I have found what I have sought, and I shall now pay the price for it.'[paragraph break]The scrape of a chair across flagstone. A sigh.[paragraph break]'Chaos treads the halls of Bedlam; her work is evident everywhere...'","The phonograph continues to play.[paragraph break]'I discredit my profession; examining madness as if the world were a fluent thing and sanity as malleable as the warm wax of a candle.'","'The secret lays heavily on both my mind and heart. I have told no one; I despair a second opinion would confirm my worst suspicions. I have secured all my knowledge of these events within the mechanical assistant left by my predecessor. It was my hope that it would allow me to see the situation from a new perspective, and help me discover the key to my salvation.'","'Alas, it has been to no avail. While I found the entry mode easy enough, and the thing seems filled with information regarding the hospital down to the point of minutiae, it seems helpless in the face of analyzing my current situation.'","'It may be that I have simply not found that by which this growing mystery may be unlocked. Perhaps by subjecting the Triage to further experiential data, it may find something that I have missed. But I have little faith left at this point.'","The sound of a chair creaking.[paragraph break]'I have found a blessing in James. He has been nothing but kind and helpful in my short time here. I find myself wondering if, perhaps, he can be trusted enough to... but how can I punish him with this knowledge?' [paragraph break]A sigh.[paragraph break]'But how can I bear it alone?'","A sudden noise, as of something wooden being struck, comes through the phonograph.[paragraph break]'No. I can trust no one, in the end. Not even James. Perhaps soon...not even myself.'","'I must stop here, I feel the faintness coming once again.'[paragraph break]A scraping noise, a click.[paragraph break]'May God have mercy [']pon my soul.'"}

Section 1(b) - The table

The table is scenery in the Office. "It sits beside the window, its surface entirely covered by the phonograph it supports." 

Section 1(c) - Triage

Triage is in the Office. "[if Triage is in Office and we have not examined Triage]A black cube on wheels sits near the door to the south.[otherwise if Triage is in Office and we have examined Triage]Triage sits near the door to the south.[otherwise]Triage rests obediently nearby."  The description is "Not a box but a cube; there is no hinge. A fine grid is engraved on its top, dividing it into a myriad of tiny squares. The cube sits on four black rubber wheels, attached by a set of brass leggings that seem capable of telescoping downward.[paragraph break]The only other feature of note is a small emerald, set in its side, beneath which is a plaque with the inscription 'TRIAGE MK. III'.[if emerald is switched on][paragraph break]Triage hums slightly as the emerald pulses with a soft, green glow." Instead of switching on Triage, try switching on the emerald.  The analysis is "CAT:TRIAGE.ANALY[line break]TICAL.ENGINE.UTI[line break]L:EXAMINATION.AN[line break]D.ANALYSIS.OF.OB[line break]JECTS.AND.DATA.P[line break]ART:TRIAGE.MK.II[line break]I.UNIT.CURRENT.O[line break]PERATOR=T.XAVIER". Understand "black box" or "cube" as Triage.

Instead of taking Triage, say "Triage is much too heavy to move about in such a manner."

The emerald is part of Triage. The emerald is a device. The emerald is switched off.  The description is "[if emerald is switched on]The size and shape of an eye, it glows steadily occasionally flickering.[otherwise]Dark green to the point of blackness, it is the size and shape of an eye."  The emerald is switched off.  Instead of pushing the emerald when the emerald is switched on, try switching off the emerald.  Instead of pushing the emerald when the emerald is switched off, try switching on the emerald.

The screen is part of Triage. Understand "grid" as the screen. The screen has some text called the current display. The description is "[if the emerald is switched off]Triage's screen is currently blank.[otherwise]The machine's screen is on and reads:[paragraph break][fixed letter spacing][the current display of the screen][variable letter spacing][run paragraph on][end if]".

Instead of switching on the emerald for the first time:
	now the emerald is switched on;
	say "From within the device comes a sharp clunk, followed by a gentle humming. The emerald blinks slowly -- once, twice -- then glows steadily. The grid of squares which makes up the thing's screen pivot back and forth, seemingly at random, causing ripples of motion across its surface.[paragraph break]With a sudden purpose, they begin to flip, revealing hundreds of tiny symbols engraved on their surfaces. The squares continue for a moment, then begin to settle line by line like a fall of rain into a pattern...[paragraph break]";
	now the current display of the screen is "INIT.CYCLE.COMP.[line break]MILL.UNIT.ONLINE[line break]STORE.DECRYPT/CO[line break]MPRESS.BOOT.STAC[line break]K.COMP.OP.SYSTEM[line break]UNIT.VER.3.REG:.[line break]DR..SIMON..BRAND[line break]SET MODE:ANALYZE[line break]";
	say "[fixed letter spacing][the current display of the screen][variable letter spacing]".

After switching on the emerald:
	say "Triage again starts up, its emerald lighting like an awakening eye."

After switching off the emerald:
	say "The emerald's light cuts off as the squares flip back to their original blank state. Triage's humming slowly lowers in pitch and volume until finally it is silent."

Instead of pointing at the screen when Triage is visible and the emerald is switched on, try pointing at Triage.
Instead of pointing at the emerald when Triage is visible and the emerald is switched on, try pointing at Triage.

Every turn:
	if the emerald is switched on:
		if the location of Triage is not the location of the player:
			let the way be the best route from the location of Triage to the location of the player, using doors;
			try Triage going the way;
			
After Triage going:
	say "[one of]Triage obediently appears.[or]Triage trundles patiently along beside.[or]Triage silently rolls to a stop.[at random]"
	
A room can be climeable or not climeable. A room is usually not climeable. 

Before going from a climeable room when Triage is visible and the emerald is switched on:
	if the noun is up or the noun is down:
		say "Cunningly extending and contracting its wheels, Triage easily follows [if the noun is up]up[otherwise]down[end if] the stairs..."

Section 1(d) - The desk

The desk is scenery in the Office. Understand "massive" or "cedar" as the desk. "A deep green blotter, dotted with black ink stains, sits in the center of the desk, mostly covered by files and papers.[if we have not looked under the blotter] One side of the blotter seems slightly higher than the other.[end if][if the sandalwood box is on the desk][paragraph break]The corner of a sandalwood box is visible beneath a stack of thick folders.[end if][paragraph break]The desk contains a large central drawer, [if the drawer is closed]which is currently closed.[otherwise]currently opened."  Instead of opening the desk, try opening the drawer. Instead of searching the desk, try examining the desk.

An openable container called a drawer is part of the desk. The description is "Nothing unusual, it sits unlocked [if the drawer is open]and open.[otherwise]but unopened.[end if][if the drawer is open and the drawer contains nothing][paragraph break]The large central drawer is empty.[end if][if the drawer is open and the drawer contains something]". The printed name of the drawer is "large central drawer". Understand "large" or "central" as the drawer. The drawer is closed. In the drawer is a manual and a flanged brass rod. 
	
The brass rod is a thing. The brass rod has a truth state called used. The used of the brass rod is usually false. The description of the brass rod is "A short rod of brass with a flange at one end (engraved with a [']6[']) and a series of tines at the other, perpendicular to the shaft." The analysis of the brass rod is "CAT:NONLIVING.TO[line break]OL.UTIL:KEY.UNLO[line break]CK.DEVICE.PART:I[line break]D=PANOPTICONKEY.[line break]CORRIDOR.6.(UPPE[line break]R).PLACE.IN.PANO[line break]PTICON.STAND.TO.[line break]ACTIVATE/ACCESS."

The manual is a thing. Understand "book" as the manual.

Instead of examining the manual:
	now the current menu is the Table of Triage Operators Manual;
	now the current menu title is "TRIAGE PERSONAL ANALYTICAL ENGINE: OPERATOR'S MANUAL MK. III";
	now the introduction boolean is 1;
	now the current menu introduction is "The manual has several headings:";
	carry out the displaying activity;
	clear the screen;
	now the introduction boolean is 0;
	try looking;

The blotter is scenery in the Office. "A standard office blotter, its surface well used and covered with stains.[if we have not looked under the blotter] One side of the blotter seems slightly higher than the other." Understand "deep" or "green" or "ink stains" as the blotter. Instead of pushing the blotter, try looking under the blotter. 
Instead of looking under the blotter for the first time:
	now the player is holding the small key;
	say "Beneath the blotter is a small key, easily taken. It carries a small tag labeled '2D'."

The small key is a thing. The printed name of the small key is "small key labled 2D". The description of the small key is "A small key with a tag which reads [']2D[']."

The sandalwood box is an openable container on the desk. The description of the box is "It is unexceptional, perhaps one handbreadth wide by three long. On its lid is a white paper label. Written upon it in a fine copperplate are the words 'JOURNAL V. 4 - JANUARY THROUGH APRIL 1855.'" The sandalwood box is scenery. The sandalwood box is portable. Before taking the sandalwood box for the first time, now the sandalwood box is not scenery. The box is closed. Instead of inserting anything that is not a cylinder into the box: say "The box seems designed to hold tin cylinders and nothing else."

The tin cylinder labeled January eighth is a cylinder in the box. The media of the January eighth cylinder is {"'January the 8th.'[paragraph break]'I am uncertain if this entry is made in joy or sorrow. I have just received word from Dr. Yeates that I am to be...promoted. I am uncertain if that term is the correct one. In any case, it seems that there has been an... incident with Bethlehem[']s current superintendent, and a replacement is required. I have been chosen for the position, at least in the short term.'","'It is fairly obviously what has prompted this move. I have moved too far, too fast and in doing so have displeased the powers that be. While Yeates has supported my ... unorthodox theories well enough, he has warned me often that he cannot shield me from *all* of the backlash that may occur. I do not believe that his using this as a segue way to telling me of my transfer was entirely unconnected...'","'Bedlam seems both purgatory and paradise at this moment. I remember the history of the place well enough -- of the Governors['] decision to renovate the site in [']15 and the slow implementation of Urquhart and Bentham[']s now infamous Panopticon Plan. In the end it was nothing more than a final stab at respectability for the site, which has now languished as a home for the hopeless, the poor, and the criminally insane for almost twenty years.'","'But the technology!  Yeates told me of a visit he took in the [']30s, when the place was still open as part zoo, part living drama. I paid little attention to his description of the patient[']s conditions and instead seized upon the description of the central Tower and its prism-viewer, by which the entire complex could be overseen by a single man, the massive Archives with their engine-run filing system...now I shall see it with my own eyes, and I am both happy and sad at the thought.'","'I have but a fortnight to prepare for the move. It has been made clear to me that this is a test -- I must prove myself good, quiet, and respectable in the eyes of the Governors. With luck, I shall be back at Bedfordshire within half a year[']s time, ready to take over when the good doctor announces his retirement.'","'Perhaps this will not be so bad. In the public eye, I shall play their game and meanwhile, I shall continue my own research, utilizing whatever materials Bedlam has to offer...'"}

The tin cylinder labeled January twenty-second is a cylinder in the box. The media of the January twenty-second cylinder is {"'January the 22nd.'[paragraph break]'Arrived in London today in preparation for taking over my duties. The cab driver took what seemed a scenic route through Smithfield, then generally southward towards Newgate. I covered my nose as best I could as we passed the slaughterhouse that was the Market, though I noted a Mechanist's shop -- Du Mondes['] -- on Fleet, which I will try to visit at my earliest convenience, as my worst fears regarding the wireless have been confirmed.'","'It probably says something profound about me that I set up the magnetophone first, while everything else remains boxed or is still on its way from Bedfordshire. As I feared, I found no signal whatsoever. A simple message of [']Calling CQ['] went completely unanswered, which is unheard of, as there is *always* someone listening, particularly in such a city as London. I fear the buildings are blocking the signal, and I'll require a booster of some sort.'","'I understood the driver's choice of route when we approached the prison from the north. A huge crowd was gathered for the public executions. I asked him about the particular individual sentenced to the gallows as we passed and he proceeded to tell me - at great length and with much relish - of the trial of one Mr. Emanuel Barthelemy. I wondered if today was something special, or if the spectacle of death always attracts such crowds.'","'I heard a cheer go up from the top of the hill as we pulled to a stop in front of the flat. I shall not take this as an omen of any sort.'","'What I've seen of the place is modest, but I am not at all surprised considering what I am paying for it. I intend to spend as little time here as possible, after all. Bedlam awaits me in the morning.'","'A final note. It seems I left the majority of my unused cylinders at Bedfordshire. I shall have to write Yeates and ask that he send them down, or perhaps seek out where I may purchase them locally. In the meantime, I shall refrain from making a phonograph-entry until something truly momentous happens.'"}

The tin cylinder labeled March second is a cylinder in the box. The media of the March second cylinder is {"'March the 2nd.'[paragraph break]'It seems the Fates have listened closely and decided to give me a momentous occasion as quickly as possible. I am beside myself. Bedlam seems nothing more than a pit in which Her Majesty may place those she wishes to forget about. Such corruption dwarfs the imagination.'","'Perhaps I overstate the case, but it was the simple ease with which the constable approached me that most horrified me. If such things as this happen as a matter of course, then the place has truly been in the hands of the mad for some time.'","'I suppose I should have seen such things coming. The Insane Prisoners['] Act passed in [']40 was vague enough that it could be used as a political tool, and McNaughton[']s trial made it clear that the courts would do so when forced, but at least such things happened in the public eye.'","'My predecessor clearly had some arrangement with the Bobbies regarding cases such as these. James told me that he met often with the constable, though he was not privy as to the content of these meetings.'","'Simply put, I was asked to make the prisoner in their charge [']disappear['] and told that I would be [']well compensated['] for keeping things quiet. Part of me wishes I had put up more of a fight...had made an issue, or...'","'But what choice have I?  It has been made clear to me that keeping things quiet is precisely what is expected of me in my time in Bedlam.'","'I have placed Cleve -- whose preternatural silence even as he struggled in his bonds gave the entire proceedings a sheen of unreality -- in the abandoned upper level of the northern wing, keeping the key separate from the rest. James showed it to me on my arrival and stated that while it still remained secure, only a few of the rooms were to be considered [']usable['].'","'Still, perhaps this is a blessing in disguise. I have complete singular access to an interesting patient. Perhaps this is the opportunity my studies have been waiting for...'"}

The papers are scenery in the Office. Understand "folders" as the papers. "They appear to be a random selection of patient's files - each one labeled with a six-element alphanumeric code. None of them seems important."  The analysis is "CAT:NONLIVING.PA[line break]PERS.UTIL:STORAG[line break]E.MEDIUM.PART:ID[line break]=GENERAL.FILES.O[line break]N.HOSPITAL.PATIE[line break]NTS.CURRENT.BUDG[line break]ETARY.CONCERNS.A[line break]ND.STATUS.......". Instead of doing something other than examining or pointing at to the papers, say "They appear to be of little consequence."

Section 1(e) - The window

The window is scenery in the Office. "The open window looks down upon the courtyard and adjoining buildings far below." Instead of searching the window, try examining the buildings. The buildings are scenery in the Office. Understand "courtyard" and "adjoining" as the buildings. The description of the buildings is "The grounds lie far below - the hard cobbles of the courtyard lead in all directions towards a clump of buildings to the west, all enclosed by an outer wall and roof above." Instead of searching the window, try examining the window. Instead of climbing the window: try entering the window.

Understand "climb through [something]", "climb over [something]", "Climb out [something]", "climb out of [something]", "jump through [something]", "jump out [something]", "jump out of [something]", "jump over [something]", "climb over [something]", "jump off [something]" as climbing.

Instead of entering the window:
	now the player is dead;
	say "It's as simple as that, then -- as the thought leaps outward, so does the body. And then all is open air and blowing wind, and the moment stretched - elongated along some impossible axis - one choice out of a million possibilities, outstretched in flight...[paragraph break]";
	perform Ending A.

Section 2 - Lobby

The description of the Lobby is "The walls and floor are a clinical white tile and marble. However, the dim lights set above this echoing space hiss and pop fitfully, giving the small maze of desks and workspaces within a tarnished, decaying look.[paragraph break]A set of solid gates lie opened and unlocked to the east and west. A small corridor runs northward and from the south, the bright light of day is visible through a set of glass doors."

After going to the Lobby for the first time:
	say "[line break][run paragraph on]";
	try looking;
	[This is a bit of a hack - Triage was following correctly, but its text appeared after the infection.]
	if the emerald is switched on:
		now Triage is in the Lobby;
		say "Triage obediently appears.[paragraph break]";
	say "The young man looks up and the corners of his mouth lift into a smile that is not quite strong enough to reach his eyes.[paragraph break]'Doctor?  Are you...'[paragraph break]Cold. Yes, the cold is familiar.[paragraph break]";

	say "[bold type]/(yesdoneyes)\[roman type][paragraph break]";
	now James is infected;

Section 2(a) - James

James is a man in the Lobby. "[if the Lobby is unvisited]Behind the most prominent desk sits a nervous young man.[otherwise]James sits behind his desk, nervously working." The description of James is "He's easily no more then twenty, with an unruly mop of black hair that continually gets in his eyes. The badge, set high near his collar, reads 'James Houlihan - Assistant - Bethlehem Hospital.'" The analysis of James is "CAT:LIVING.HUMAN[line break]MALE.UTIL:COMMUN[line break]ICATION.POSSIBLE[line break]BY.SPEECH.OR.WRI[line break]TTEN.WORD.PART:I[line break]D=JAMES.HOULIHAN[line break]POSITION.ASSISTA[line break]NT.AT.BETHLEHEM.". Understand "Houlihan" or "Assistant" or "young" or "man" as James. Understand "corpse", "blood" as James when James is dead.

Every turn:
	if James is visible and James is alive:
		if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds:
			say "[one of]James carefully fills out a set of forms, then files them.[or]James stares out into space for a long moment.[or]James bites his lower lip as he stamps out a set of forms.[or]James searches under his desk a moment for a lost pen.[or]James stands and stretches his legs for a moment before resuming his seat.[or]James shudders suddenly, then looks at you sheepishly.[or]James taps his fingers nervously.[or]James looks at you curiously, as if searching for something in your eyes.[or]James sighs.[at random]"
			
Instead of attacking James:
	now James is dead;
	now the description of James is "The corpse of James Houlihan according to his badge - late assistant at Bethlehem Hospital. The handle of an ivory paper knife protrudes from his sternum. Blood slowly leaks from the wound, pools about his slack limbs and across the floor.";
	now the printed name of James is "James['] corpse";
	now the initial appearance of James is "James['] corpse is here.";
	move the ivory paper knife to James;
	say "James collapses to the floor, staring with shock and surprise. But it is when he sees the ivory paper knife lifted from under a stack of papers on his desk that true panic sets in.[paragraph break]He scrambles backwards, desperate to get to his feet. Unable to find purchase on the tile floor, he only manages to flounder about like a drunken crab.  He tries to scream for help but his voice fails him, squeaking out in only a whisper.[paragraph break]Assistance does not come.[paragraph break]He has scrambled himself into a corner. The look of resigned fear in his eyes in terrible. 'May God forgive you,' he whispers as he closes them.[paragraph break]Blood, deep and red, bubbles from him and spoils the hygienic floor.[paragraph break]";
	spur on the Logos;
		
The ivory paper knife is a thing. The description of the knife is "A finely made knife with a handle carved in the shape of a caduceus. Normally used to open letters and separate book pages, it is currently embedded in James' chest." Instead of taking or pushing or pulling the knife, say "The knife is imbedded too far."

Section 2(b) - Scenery

The gates are scenery in the Lobby. Understand "gate" as the gates. Instead of opening or closing or pushing or pushing the gates to, say "The gates are far too massive to accomplish that by hand, evidenced by the gearwork built into the walls."

The gears are scenery in the Lobby. Understand "cogs" as the gears. The description of the gears is "A series of cogs and gears designed to automatically open and close the gates as necessary."

The lights are scenery in the Lobby. Understand "gaslight" or "chandeliers" as the lights. The description of the lights is "The series of gaslight chandeliers set along the distant ceiling are overwhelmed by the vast size of the room; shadows lurk everywhere."

The lobby doors are scenery in the Lobby. Understand "glass" or "door" as the doors. The description of the lobby doors is "Nothing more than a simple line of glass doors leading southward into daylight."

The lobby desks are scenery in the Lobby. Understand "desk" as the desks. The description of the lobby desks is "Worn and dusty with disuse, a fleet of abandoned desks slowly sinks into decay. James' desk, on its dais, is a tiny island of order." Instead of doing something other than examining to the lobby desks, say "The abandoned desks are of no use, they contain nothing but dust."

James' desk is scenery in the Lobby. The description of James' desk is "It is covered in neat stacks of forms that James moves in unfathomable patterns: stamping some, filing others, and occasionally dropping one to the floor." Instead of doing something other than examining to James' desk, say "James might find that to be intrusive."

Section 3 - Archives

The description of the Archives is "This room is mostly empty space. The farthest wall is lined with gleaming, brass pull-file drawers and seems to go on infinitely in every direction. The entrance to the west opens onto a solid, dusty platform, which allows visitors to stand suspended above the unseen floor." Instead of going nowhere from the Archives, say "Ignoring the railing would most likely result in a rather fatal fall."

Section 3(a) - The Pedestal

The pedestal is in the Archives. "At the end of the platform lies a pedestal topped with a small, inverted onyx pyramid." The pedestal is fixed in place. The description of the pedestal is "It is shaped like a pulpit. On its flat surface is small panel containing a dial and small glass display and delicately balanced at its top is an inverted black pyramid." The analysis of the pedestal is "CAT:NONLIVING.TO[paragraph break]OL.UTIL:ARCHIVE.[paragraph break]INTERFACE.PART:F[paragraph break]ILE.NUMBER.INPUT[paragraph break]VIA.DIAL.OUTPUT.[paragraph break]VIA.PAPERTAPE.DI[paragraph break]SPLAY.PYRAMID=RE[paragraph break]TRIVAL.UNIT....."

The panel is part of the pedestal. The description of the panel is "Its flat black surface contains a dial and a small glass display." Instead of pointing at the panel, try pointing at the pedestal. 

The pedestal has a text called the current input. The current input is "STARCF".

Section 3(b) - The Dial

The dial is part of the panel. The dial has some text called the current setting. The current setting of the dial is "1". The description of the dial is "The dial seems capable of being set to any number between 1 and 9 as well as the letters A through F. It currently rests at [the current setting of the dial]." Instead of turning the dial, say "[bracket]Specify a valid value to set the dial to.[close bracket][line break]". The analysis of the dial is "CAT:NONLIVING.TO[line break]OL.UTIL:ARCHIVE.[line break]INTERFACE.PART:F[line break]ILE.NUMBER.INPUT[line break]FILE.NUMBER=SIX.[line break]DIGIT.ALPHANUMER[line break]IC.CODE.COMPLETI[line break]ON=RETRIEVAL...."

Understand "turn [something] to [text]" as setting it to. Understand "set [something]" as turning.

Check setting something to (this is the block setting symbolically rule): 
	say "That cannot be set to anything." 

Instead of setting the dial to the topic understood:

Understand "spider" as the pyramid. The pyramid has a truth state called used. The used of the pyramid is false. 

[This is a much cleaner way of changing the base rules...]
[PREVIOUSLY: Procedural rule while examining the pyramid: ignore the examine containers rule.]
The examine containers rule does nothing when examining the pyramid.

Section 3(e) - Scenery

The wall of drawers is scenery in the Archives. The description of the wall of drawers is "There must be thousands of them - they extend yards in all directions, vanishing into the gloom." Instead of doing something other than examining or pointing at to the drawers, say "The drawers are far too distant to do anything with.".

The archive railing is scenery in the Archives. The description of the archive railing is "The platform is surrounded on three sides by a low metal railing, the better to prevent an unfortunate drop into the vacuum below. Footprints mark and remark the dust, forming a trail from the lobby to the pedestal and back." Understand "platform" as the archive railing.

Instead of climbing the archive railing:

Section 4 - Walkways

A walkway is a kind of room with printed name "Walkway" and description "ERROR!". Instead of going nowhere from a walkway, say "Straying from the walkway would most likely result in a rather fatal fall." A walkway has a text called entrance. A walkway has a text called exit. The description of a walkway is "The slight wind whistles tunelessly against this mesh of steel, which arcs from one massive, opened gate to another. A roof curves far overhead, enclosing both the block-like building to the [entrance] and the narrow tower to the [exit]. Far below, an intricate set of sub-buildings can be seen, enclosed within the complex's outer wall.". 

West_Walkway is a walkway. The entrance of West_Walkway is "east". The exit of West_Walkway is "west".

	say "The ground is much closer than expected. There is no pain, only darkness...[paragraph break]";
	choose an ending;

Section 5 - Panopticon

The description of the Circular Chamber is "The hum of machinery is ever present here, rumbling down into the sub-sonics. Pale white walls encircle a series of engraved circles on the floor, and at the center - like the pupil of some great eye - sits a round console which reaches all the way up to the ceiling.[paragraph break]The room's single exit lies to the [if the activated of the keyhole is false]east.[otherwise]north."

Before going north in the Circular Chamber:
	if the activated of the keyhole is false, say "No exit lies in that direction." instead.
Before going east in the Circular Chamber:
	if the activated of the keyhole is true, say "No exit lies in that direction." instead.

The walls of the chamber are scenery in the Circular Chamber. Understand "pale" or "white" or "walls" or "circles" as the walls of the chamber. The description of the walls of the chamber is "The walls and floor are pale, white and seamless except for the engraved circles.

The console is scenery in the Circular Chamber. The description of the console is "It is complex, divided into several discrete sections. Set on a panel is a diagram - a blueprint. A small slot for the dispensing of paper tape lies beside it. Set above the diagram is a prism-viewer complete with two handles. A set of brass listening-tubes terminate on either side of the viewer." The analysis of the console is "CAT:NONLIVING.TO[line break]OL.UTIL:PANOPTIC[line break]ON.MAIN.CONSOLE.[line break]CAPABLE.OF.VIEWI[line break]NG.ANY.CELL.IN.H[line break]OSPITAL.WITH.BOT[line break]VISUAL&AUDIO.OUT[line break]PUT+CODE.STORAGE"

The panopticon panel is scenery in the Circular Chamber. Understand "blueprint" or "diagram" as the panopticon panel. The description of the panopticon panel is "Intricate in its detail, it depicts a series of twenty-four corridors set about a circular room like the spokes of a wheel. Each corridor opens onto six rooms, three on each side, with one exception: a hall at 3 o'clock instead connects to a building labeled 'Administration.'[paragraph break]At the center of the circular room is a keyhole. Beside it is a two-headed arrow, pointing up and down.[paragraph break]Beneath the blueprint is a series of buttons: six labeled A through F and one with an inverted triangle from which six small lines emerge.

The analysis of the triangle button is "CAT:NONLIVING.TO[line break]OL.UTIL:PANOPTIC[line break]ON.BLUEPRINT.PAR[line break]T:PRINT.ACTIVELY[line break]SELECTED.CELL/PA[line break]TIENT.RELATIONSH[line break]IP.CODE[bracket]PAPERTAP[line break]E[close bracket].VIA.TRIANGLE."

Instead of pushing the triangle button:
	if the pressed button of the panopticon panel is nothing or the paper code of the pressed button of the panopticon panel is nothing or the dispensed of the paper code of the pressed button of the panopticon panel is true:
		say "The button clicks downward, then returns to its original state when released. Nothing more happens.";
	otherwise:
		now the dispensed of the paper code of the pressed button of the panopticon panel is true;
		move the paper code of the pressed button of the panopticon panel to the player;
		say "The button clicks downward, then returns to its original state when released. Nothing more seems to happen for a moment, then a sudden clattering is emitted from the console's slot from which emerges a paper tape. A moment or two later, both the noise and the tape stop. Easily torn from the console, it reveals the symbols '[the code of the paper code of the pressed button of the panopticon panel]' imprinted on its surface."
		
Section 6 - Corridor 6

The description of Corridor 6 is "Were it not for the complex's enclosing walls and ceiling, this hall would certainly be left at the mercy of the elements - no surface stands unbroken or unpitted.[paragraph break]The eastern wall is set with a series of labeled doorways: to the northeast lies A, to the east B, to the southeast C.[paragraph break]The western wall is much the same: to the southwest is D, to the west E, to the northwest F. [paragraph break]The door to the south is labeled simply 'Panopticon'." Instead of going east from Corridor 6, say "The door to room 6B seems stuck fast - from behind it can be heard the steady drip of water." Instead of going west from Corridor 6, say "The room beyond the door to the west seems to have collapsed in on itself - the door swings inwards to immediately strike an impenetrable mound of rubble." Instead of going northwest from Corridor 6, say "The lock and handle on the door to 6F seem broken - making it unopenable. The sound of wind faintly blowing can be heard beyond it, though."

The hallway door is scenery in Corridor 6. The hallway door is a container. Instead of doing anything with the hallway door, say "That's of no importance."

The description of Room 6A is "A room that has been stripped almost completely bare - its only pretense at furniture is a small, hard chair thrown off to one side. Its single exit lies to the southwest."

The pipework is scenery in Room 6A. Understand "exposed", "wall", "pipes" and "pipe" as the pipework. The description of the pipework is "Some exposed pipework can be seen along the room's southern wall, from within emanates the faint sound of a cricket's chirping." Instead of doing something other than examining to the pipework, say "There doesn't seem to be much utility in fiddling with the pipework." Instead of listening while the player is in Room 6A, say "There is a faint buzzing whine in the air, seeming to come from the southern wall."

The chair is a backdrop. It is in Room 6A and Room 6D. Understand "small", "hard" as the chair. The description of the chair is "It is so much junk - brittle and old, it is unlikely it could bear any weight whatsoever." Instead of doing something other than examining to the chair, say "It's useless -- better to leave it be."

Every turn:
	if the player is in Room 6A:
		if a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds:
			say "[one of]A faint, shrill sound can be heard from a poorly concealed pipe in the corner.[or]It sounds as if an insect is caught somewhere in the room.[or]There is a faint sound emanating from some pipework near the south wall.[or]A piercing tone fills the air for a brief moment.[at random]"

The description of Room 6B is "A room slowly filling with water - a broken pipe lies at one end, slowly dripping into an ever growing pool.[paragraph break]A stuck and broken door lies on the western side."

The description of Room 6C is "A room whose floor seems in danger of collapse - a hole has started forming in its center and the edges slowly slope in towards it. Its single exit lies to the northwest."

The hole is scenery in Room 6C. The description of the hole is "The hole is approximately the size of a clenched fist, and beyond only darkness can be seen. The floor surrounding it seems anything but stable."  Instead of doing something other than examining or pointing at to the hole, say "The whole area seems perilously close to collapse - best not to linger."

The description of Room 6D is "An old room that - while crumbling around the edges - is fairly sturdy and secure. Its dusty floor holds nothing more than a cot and a crumbling chair. A set of gas light fixtures hangs off the wall, blocked and in disrepair and a door lies to the northeast.[paragraph break]The walls are covered with writing."

The writing is scenery in Room 6D. The description of the writing is "[if the player is in Room 6D]In the walls' current state, it must not have been too difficult to scratch a message into - but the preciseness of the writing is still impressive. Various phrases are carved in a generally circular pattern about an intricate set of lines and circles at the center, within which is inscribed:[paragraph break][fixed letter spacing]Z X W H T G B W H T F G W H T F G B Z X W H T[variable letter spacing][paragraph break]The outer writing reads, variously:[paragraph break][fixed letter spacing]LOGOS EN SOPH       NOTARIKON        AND A LITTLE[line break]                                                  CHLD[line break]MKLTH               GEMATRIA                      2693[line break]19876                                             MCHN[line break]KTHR                TEMURAH                       1262[line break]8765                                 SHALL LEAD THEM[variable letter spacing][otherwise]The writing is too small to make out through the prism-viewer."

The cot is scenery in Room 6D. The description of the cot is "A small, well worn cot, almost worn through from use." Instead of doing something other than examining to the cot, say "The cot holds no use."

The gas light fixtures are scenery in Room 6D. Understand "lights" as the gas light fixtures. The description of the fixtures is "Their flickering fills the room with uneasy shadows." Instead of doing something other than examining to the fixtures, say "The lights look as if they will go out any moment as it is. Best to leave them alone."

The description of Room 6E is "The mirrors in the viewed room must have shattered, for the view is diffracted into a thousand reflected shards - each one showing grey stone."

The description of Room 6F is "A room whose northern wall has completely collapsed, revealing empty space with an outer wall and ceiling visible in the distance. The floor is covered with strewn rubble."

Section 7 - Courtyard

The description of the Courtyard is "This walled off area sits at the bottom of a massive staircase which leads into the building to the north. At its base is a sign reading 'Bethlehem Hospital - Administration.' The outer walls meet here - meeting at the distant gates which sit to the southeast."

After going from the Lobby to the Courtyard for the first time: 
	try looking;
	say "When he hears footsteps clatter across the courtyard, the driver tilts his hat back and says 'Where to then, Doc?' with a smile."
	
[Why must this be "instead of going southeast IN" versus "instead of going southeast FROM?" The latter compiles fine, but fails to work?]
Instead of going southeast in the Courtyard for the first time, say "Moorsfield is bustling with activity this time of day and evidence of such can be heard as the gates draw closer. Voices piled upon voices, echoing through the streets and alleyways.[paragraph break][bold type]/(manyvoicemindstoo?)\[roman type][paragraph break]The first streets become visible - masses of humanity moving about -[paragraph break][bold type]/(overtoonumbersspreadingthingfartoo)\[roman type][paragraph break]machines - horses - minds - voices - and cold - a freezing that locks the legs, that slows and stops...[paragraph break][bold type]/(nononohurtmanyechofarnono)\[roman type][paragraph break]Yes - yes this is better, pulling back, away, not towards.

No need to go out into *that*, then ser. I'm at yer service.'"
Instead of doing it more than one time, say "The cold again. And a numbness of the body. And an inability to resist."

Section 7(a) - Scenery

The hospital is scenery in the Courtyard. Understand "stairs", "staircase", "building", "Bethlehem", "Hospital", "Administration", "sign", "outer", "walls", "wall" or "gate" as the hospital. The description of the hospital is "The courtyard is quiet, cut off from the bustle of Moorsfield by the outer wall. The Hospital's sign and staircase lead smoothly up to the Administration building to the north, their path shadowed by the massive statues above."

The statues are in the Courtyard. "Flanking the top of the staircase on either side are two colossal statues." Understand "mania", "melancholy" and "raving" as the statues. The description of the statues is "Human figures, they are -- bald and muscular, naked except for a stream of cloth about their waists, each lying against an arch of stone. The leftmost - Melancholy - grips the ground beneath him with a look of placid despair. On the right lies Mania, struggling against his chains." The analysis of the statues is "CAT:NONLIVING.ST[line break]ATUES.UTIL:UNKNO[line break]N.PART:[']RAVING.M[line break]ANIA[']&[']MELANCHOL[line break]Y.MANIA['].CREATED[line break]BY.ROBERT.HOOKE.[line break]DESIGNER.OF.ORIG[line break]INAL.HOSPITAL..." Instead of doing something other than examining to the statues, say "The statues are far out of reach."

[if Reginald is alive]In[otherwise]It's[end if] driver's seat, set at the rear of the vehicle, sits [if Reginald is alive]its smiling driver.[otherwise]empty."

Instead of going inside when the hansom cab is visible, try entering the hansom cab.
Instead of going by the hansom cab, say "From inside the hansom cab?"

After entering the cab:
	say "Entered.[paragraph break]";
	if Triage is visible and the emerald is switched on:
		now Triage is in the cab;
		say "Faced with the task of climbing into the cab, Triage is more than up to the challenge. Raising and extending first two wheels and then the others, it clambers inside beside."
		
After exiting from the cab:
	say "Exited.[paragraph break]";
	if Triage is visible and the emerald is switched on:
		now Triage is in the location;
		say "Triage gracefully climbs out of the cab beside."

Section 7(c) - Betsy

Betsy is part of the hansom cab. Understand "horse" as Betsy. The description of Betsy is "Poor thing - she looks as if she'll fall over any moment." Instead of doing something other than examining or pointing at to Betsy, say "The old eyes blink balefully once, before turning away. Perhaps she wishes to be left alone." The analysis of Betsy is "CAT:LIVING.HORSE[line break](EQUUS.FERUS.CAB[line break]ALLUS).FEMALE.UT[line break]IL:TRANSPORTATIO[line break]N/PULLING:(FARMI[line break]NG.WARFARE.POLIC[line break]ING)PART:ID=BETS[line break]Y.OWNER=REGINALD"

Understand "corpse" as Reginald when Reginald is dead.

Instead of attacking Reginald:
	now Reginald is dead;
	now the description of Reginald is "The corpse lies crumpled against the alley's wall.";
	now the printed name of Reginald is "Reggie's corpse";
	now the initial appearance of Reginald is "Reggie's corpse is here.";
	say "A false destination. It is as easy as that.[paragraph break]The cab turns down a vacant alley that ends in a wall. It goes fast at first. Reggie yelps in surprise as the gloved fingers close around his throat. He thrashes, but he is old and can not overtake the grip that holds him fast.[paragraph break]The most he manages is to turn around and stare with surprised, horrified eyes, his fingers clutching his throat, desperate to make room for air.[paragraph break]It does not take long for the life to slide from behind his eyes turning them to glass. Even still the fingers keep gripping, one, two minutes more to be sure. When they let go, Reggie's body slumps and falls to the ground.[paragraph break]There is a sickening thud as bones break on impact and the carriage rolls to a stop...";
	if Triage is visible and the emerald is switched on, move Triage to Alley;
	move Reginald to Alley;
	move the hansom cab to Alley;
	move the player to Alley;
	spur on the Logos;
		
Alley is a room. The description of Alley is "A narrow space between walls, barely enough for the cab to navigate."
Instead of going nowhere from Alley:

The one directly north contains a door labeled 2D.[paragraph break]To the west is the massive stone edifice that is Newgate Gaol. A gallows prepared for tomorrow's public execution, towers over the street."

The gaol is scenery in Outside Flat 2D. "All stone and shadow. What few windows the are available are covered with heavy iron bars." Instead of doing something other than examining to the gaol, say "The prison lies at the top of the hill, far to the west." Understand "Newgate", "stone", "edifice" as the gaol.

Section 2 - Flat 2D

The description of Flat 2D is "Despite being small and cluttered with bits and pieces of electronics, this one room flat gives the impression of being quite clean and hygienic; no dust or dirt lurk in its bright corners. The east wall holds a mirror, and is neatly lined with evenly spaced picture frames.

If you are sure your power source is active, toggle your switch.[paragraph break][bold type]2. Problem: All I hear is static or I can hear other operators, but they can't hear me speak, or they do not answer.[roman type][line break]To broadcast, be sure to depress the TRANSMIT button each time you wish to speak. While the TRANSMIT button is not depressed, your magnetophone acts as a receiver, not a transmitter. Also, be sure to use proper etiquette while operating your Magnetophone. To let another operator know you wish to make contact, press the TRANSMIT button and use the universally accepted phrase 'Calling CQ'. If you fail to use this code, other operators may believe they are picking up the middle of an alternate conversation, and will not respond for fear of interrupting.[paragraph break][bold type]3. Problem: I can hear static and voices, but they are faint or indistinct.[roman type][line break]Magnetophone customers living in highly-populated, urban areas may experience transmission interference due to the presence of large buildings, crowded streets, and pollution. You may try alleviate to this problem by placing the Magnetophone by a clear opening - such as a window. If this does not fix the problem, you may need to purchase one of several amplification devices, designed to fit into your machine's expansion slot."

Section 2(c) - Magnetophone

Section 3 - Before the Gallows

The description of Before the Gallows is "Set directly beside the towering stone walls of Newgate Gaol, the scaffolding's staircase rises northward, leading up to a tall, wide stage. Above, the noose sways gently in the breeze.[paragraph break]The slow dip of the hill takes the road eastward and down to where the hansom cab waits."

The scaffolding is scenery in Before the Gallows. "The scaffolding, while solid, is clearly modular to enable it to be removed easily after the execution. The noose hangs across a shaft of midday sun, its shadow swelling eastward."

The gaol walls are scenery in Before the Gallows. "Imposing from a distance, the gaol's walls now dwarf everything about them." Instead of doing something other than examining to the gaol walls, say "There is apparently no way to enter the gaol from here -- all that can be seen are the walls." Understand "wall" as the gaol walls. 

Before going from Before the Gallows to Platform, say "A short flight of stairs, but the walk up to the gallows is still a long one..."

Section 4 - Platform

The description of Platform is "A wide flat plane of solid wood, above which - at eye level - hangs the noose. Just below there is the thin outline of trapdoor, perhaps ten feet by eight. Directly beside the stairs, off to the left, an automaton waits, unmoving."

The automaton is scenery in Platform. "The automaton stands directly beside the stairs - a grotesque parody of a man. Its heavy torso, only partially enclosed in black robes, grows right from the stage floor, the cogs and gears that serve as its organs exposed. Its massive arms grip an iron switch.[paragraph break]A red button sits on the platform directly beside it." Understand "man", "executioner", "torso", "robes", "cogs", "gears", "executioner's", "mask" as the automaton.

Instead of pushing the red button:
	If the activated of the red button is false:
		now the activated of the red button is true;
		say "The button begins to glow. Beside it, the automaton pulls itself upright with a whir and a groan as the floor rumbles with the distinct sound of a steam engine springing to life beneath the stage.";
	otherwise:
		now the activated of the red button is false;
		say "The button stops glowing as both the automaton and the unseen steam engine shut off."
		
The noose is scenery in Platform. The noose has a truth state called worn. The worn of the noose is false. The description of the noose is "The noose is made of new, stout rope. A closer inspection reveals a series of fine wires woven into the knot. These run up the length of the rope, over the beams, down along the back of the stage and vanish beneath the automaton." Understand "rope", "wire", "wires" as the noose.

Instead of jumping while the Platform encloses the player:
	if the worn of the noose is true:
		say "The edge of the platform cannot be reached while still wearing the noose.";
	otherwise:
		say "It's a short enough jump to the ground...";
		try going south;
	
Instead of pushing the red button when the worn of the noose is true:
	say "The button is too far away to reach while wearing the noose."
	
[PREVIOUSLY: A procedural rule when wearing or taking off the noose: 
	ignore the carrying requirements rule; 
	ignore the can't wear what's not held rule.]
The carrying requirements rule does nothing when wearing or taking off the noose.
The can't wear what's not held rule does nothing when wearing or taking off the noose.

Instead of wearing the noose:
	if the worn of the noose is false:
		say "The noose slips easily enough over the head.";
		now the worn of the noose is true;
		if the activated of the red button is true:
			say "[line break]The fit is loose at first, then with a noise from above the wires pull upward causing it to tighten. An unseen bell gongs from beneath, shaking the floorboards.[paragraph break]With a rapid series of clicks, cogs grinding against cogs, the automaton turns its head towards the empty street. There is a hiss of static, then a recorded voice speaks: [paragraph break]'All good people, pray heartily unto God for this poor sinner who is now going to his death, for whom the great bell tolls.'[paragraph break]More clicks, and the automaton turns to face the noose. The static sounds like steam leaking.[paragraph break]'You that are condemned to die, repent with lamentable tears; ask mercy of the Lord for the salvation of your soul. You have one minute remaining of your life. You may use this time to beg forgiveness of God and the Good People of this Great Kingdom, or to make your peace with your maker in silence. Your minute begins now.'[paragraph break]A minute to reflect. A minute to regret. A minute to repent.[paragraph break]Suddenly, the trap door snaps open. The landscape rises up in a rush, a quick jerk, and then, darkness.[paragraph break]";

Instead of going when the worn of the noose is true:
	say "That's impossible while still wearing the noose."

The trap door is scenery in Platform. "Currently closed, it covers a good deal of the platform directly beneath the noose." Instead of opening the trap door, say "The door will not open to any amount of force." Instead of attacking the trap door, say "The door holds strong.

Instead of going nowhere from Smithfield Market for the first time, say "[bold type]/(soundcolorlightmovement)\[roman type][paragraph break]Smithfield is a riot of sensation - claustrophobic and...cold?[paragraph break][bold type]/(overtoonumbersspreadingthingfartoo)\[roman type][paragraph break]The place is a whirlwind - too much motion too much thought and voices and words...[paragraph break][bold type]/(nononohurtmanyechofarnono)\[roman type][paragraph break]The cold is out there - freezing will and body both. Better to say here, in the quiet and the warmth. Yes. Better to stay.[paragraph break][bold type]/(yesbackhideyesnowonlyhide)\[roman type][paragraph break]".
Instead of going nowhere from Smithfield Market more than one time, say "[bold type]/(no)\[roman type][paragraph break]The cold again. And a numbness of the body. And an inability to resist."

The crowds are scenery in Smithfield Market. The description of the crowds is "So many of them. So many. And not a single one still. The Market is a living aggregate - a singular plural - moving, shouting, screaming, growing in every direction within range of ear and eye."

Section 2 - 1428 Fleet Street

The printed name of Fleet Street is "1428 Fleet Street".

The largest, set on the south side of the street, is decorated with a gaudy sign which reads 'Du Monde's - Mechanist of Repute Since 1803.'  Along the same building - to the southeast - lies a small door which reads, simply, '1428.'"

The shops are scenery in Fleet Street. The description of the shops is "All currently useless: the clothier overflowing with customers, the programmers only open by appointment, and 'Madame Zola' having apparently gone out for lunch." Instead of doing something other than examining to the shops, say "Useless, all of them." Understand "specialist", "shops", "uniform", "clothiers", "engine-programmer", "fortune-teller" as the shops.

The storefront is scenery in Fleet Street. The description of the storefront is "The dingy window of the shop is populated with all manner of steam operated and aether-harnessing devices.

Understand "mechanist", "shop", "Du Monde's" as the storefront.

The display window is scenery in Fleet Street. The description of the display window is "Metal tubing of varying widths and varieties. Boxes large and small, thin and wide, all of them no doubt housing intricate analytical devices. Cogs and gears in more sizes one could imagine."

Instead of going nowhere from Fleet Street:

	otherwise:
		say "No exit lies in that direction.";

Section 3 - Du Monde's

The description of Du Monde's is "The shop is dark, and crowded with haphazardly stacked, yet neatly organized piles of machinery. To the south, there is a worn wooden counter, cracked with age and covered with innumerable nicks, scratches, and dark burn marks.  Behind the counter are rows and rows of drawers, labeled in some arcane script. The faint scent of gas clings to the walls.[paragraph break]The shop's show window and door look out on Fleet Street to the north. A second door lies behind the counter to the east."

After going to Du Monde's for the first time:
	try looking;
	say "It comes easier this time, the coldness frightening in its familiarity.[paragraph break][bold type]/(yesmoreyesplantquestfurthergrowyes)\[roman type][paragraph break]It is faster, too - somehow more...efficient?[paragraph break][bold type]/(soundnoisevoicecallinggreetinggrasping)\[roman type][paragraph break]A trickle becoming a break becoming a rush.[paragraph break][bold type]/(expansionaugmentationincreasematurity)\[roman type][paragraph break]It finishes its unfolding, collapsing backwards, inwards.[paragraph break][bold type]/(complexityinvestigationmoreyesmore)\[roman type][paragraph break]The woman looks up suddenly, her eyes huge ovals magnified five times their normal size by monocles squinted tightly in each eye. She opens them wide, releases the monocles and drops them into an already bulging shirt pocket. She straightens, wiping her hands on a on a dirty rag.[paragraph break]Her greasy shirtsleeves are rolled up to the elbows, and ill-fitting, thick trousers pool and disappear into the tops of her workman's boots.[paragraph break]She smiles thinly.[paragraph break]'So sorry, sir. I didn't catch what you said. Sometimes when I'm concentrating that hard, everything outside my head sounds like gibberish.'";

The description of Du Monde is "Tall and thin, though her figure is difficult to make out in men's clothes that are ill-suited for her frame. Her curly, auburn hair is tied back in a simple ponytail at the nape of her neck. Her fierce green eyes are bright and aware, though they crinkle their corners.[if Du Monde wears the pin][paragraph break]She wears a small pin on her lapel." The analysis of Du Monde is "CAT:LIVING.HUMAN[line break]FEMALE.UTIL:COMM[line break]UNICATION.POSSIB[line break]LE(SPEECH.OR.WRI[line break]TTEN.WORD)PART:I[line break]D=UNKNOWN.FURTHE[line break]R.ANALYSIS-POSSI[line break]BLE.EXAMINATION?" Understand "woman" as Du Monde. Understand "corpse", "blood" as Du Monde when Du Monde is dead.

Every turn:
	if Du Monde is visible and Du Monde is alive:
		if a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds:
			say "[one of]Du Monde clucks her tongue impatiently.[or]Du Monde searches futilely behind the counter for something.[or]Du Monde opens a drawer and pulls out a tool.[or]Du Monde briefly consults a manual before returning to work.[or]Du Monde taps her fingers on the counter impatiently.[or]Du Monde distractedly chews at a loose piece of her dangling hair.[or]Du Monde places the piece on the counter and looks at it angrily for a moment. With a frown, she reclaims it and continues her work.[or]Du Monde finishes whatever she was working on. From behind the counter she produces another small piece of machinery and begins to fiddle with it.[or]Du Monde stares out the window for a long moment.[or]Du Monde bites her lower lip as she continues to work.[at random]";

Instead of attacking Du Monde:

	say "Alexandra leans intently over her device, so focused that she does not feel the hand wind itself into her pony tail until it is almost flat against her head. She looks up and gasps as fingers tangle themselves tightly in her hair.[paragraph break]She tries to simultaneously strike out with her tool and pull herself free, but there is not enough time to do either before her head is slammed into the countertop again and again and again.[paragraph break]She stops struggling, and falls heavily against the countertop when she is released, her head oozing with blood. She spits defiantly, a trail of blood and spittle dripping from her lips.[paragraph break]'Monster,' she accuses with her last, raspy breath. 'Monster.'[paragraph break]";
	move the pin to Du Monde's;
	move the heavy key to Du Monde's;
	spur on the Logos;
				
Section 3(b) - The cypherist pin

Du Monde wears a pin. The description of the pin is "A circular pin, depicting a tree with ten branches.

After examining the pin for the first time:
	if Du Monde is alive:
		say "She notices your interest in the pin, and her fingers fondle it protectively. For just a moment her eyes reflect something - fear? anger? - and her face reddens deeply; then her countenance dissolves into a charming embarrassment, complete with a slight blush.[paragraph break]'My nephew gave it to me. Found it on the street most likely. I put it on to please him, and forget it was even here. How silly of me.'[paragraph break]She deftly removes the pin and drops it in her pocket.[paragraph break]'Now what can I assist you with?'";

The rows of drawers are scenery in Du Monde's. The description of the rows of drawers is "Narrow drawers, like those seen in an apothecary shop, line the wall behind the counter from floor to ceiling.

Instead of doing something other than examining to the rows of drawers, say "[if Du Monde is alive]'Sorry, sir. The counter area is for staff only, and by that I mean me.

The puzzle box is a locked openable container. Instead of opening the box when the box is locked,  say "The box is apparently locked, though there's no obvious way to undo this." 

The analysis of the puzzle box is "CAT:NONLIVING.TO[line break]OL.UTIL:STORAGE.[line break]PART:COMPLEX.MEC[line break]ANISM.DETECTED.E[line break]NGRAVING+WRITING[line break]=KABBALAH?TREEOF[line break]LIFE/YGGDRASIL?B[line break]UTTONS=SEPHIROTH".

Its roots trail downwards, into a dull red glow while its upper branches are bathed in a white light.[paragraph break]A series of raised buttons overlays the tree, each with a word inscribed on it. Generally, from top to bottom they read:[paragraph break]Kether, Binah, Chokmah, Gevurah, Chesed, Hod, Tipareth, Netzach, Yesod, Malkuth". Some puzzle buttons that are part of the engraving of a tree are defined by the Table of Available Puzzle Buttons. The puzzle box has a list of puzzle buttons called the solution.

The solution of the puzzle box is {Malkuth, Kether, Kether, Malkuth}. 

After pushing a puzzle button:
	say "The button depresses with a slight 'click.' Nothing more happens";
	truncate the current combination of the puzzle box to the last 3 entries;
	add the noun to the current combination of the puzzle box;
	if the current combination of the puzzle box is the solution of the puzzle box:
		if the puzzle box is locked:

			now the box is unlocked;
		otherwise:
			say ", since the box is already unlocked.";
	otherwise:
		say "."
		
A letter is in the puzzle box.

Instead of examining the letter, say "Folded but unsealed, it was apparently never sent. It reads:[paragraph break]Brothers:[paragraph break]Yes, I call you Brothers, though due to my age and alleged lack of knowledge you have denied me entrance into your Order. But as Seneca said, [italic type]Nullum saeculum magnis ingeniis clausum est[roman type]. I am proud to offer you indisputable proof that my generation is no exception.[paragraph break]As you must well know by now,  I discovered the existence and nature of your enclave during my time at University. Excited by tenets so similar to my own: the celebration of intellect, the recognition of information as an entity rather than an idea, the embrasure and development of new technologies to unlock the mysteries of the Universe itself, I left my feeble schooling, gathered my few worldly possessions and came to study at your collected feet.[paragraph break]But trapped in your antiquated and outmoded ways, clinging more to superstition and myth than logic and reason - you refused me. Oh, you commended my 'ability to solve puzzles' and patted me on the head like a dog that returned a thrown ball. You allowed me to work for one of your lesser number, mindlessly churning out one insignificant apparatus after another - a mere journeyman in your archaic system.[paragraph break]Undeterred, I remained near by, studying where I could, observing in secret and working towards one goal: proving my worth and value to you. Tonight I have the rare and singular privilege to tell you that not only have I proved, beyond doubt or measure, my value. I have exceeded you. I have succeeded where you have failed, and I have gone further than you ever dared dream.[paragraph break]I have leapt the Sephinroth in one bound, from Malkuth to Kether. [italic type]Kai theos en ho logos[roman type]. I have heard that Word, Brothers - echoing across eternity. I have touched the mind of God - of Information pure and unsullied by the mere mind of Man.[paragraph break]My contact was brief, but glorious. The brevity of it was, I'm sure, due to the crude and simple nature of your mechanisms. The resulting damage was, of course, regrettable, but once I relate to you the breadth and wonder of my experience, I think you will agree: [italic type]exitus acta probat[roman type].[paragraph break]I eagerly await your response, Brothers: of when we shall meet to discuss my entry to the Order, and our ascendance upon the wings of this discovery towards a transcendent future.[paragraph break][italic type]Veritas Lux Mea[paragraph break]Cleve G. Anderson[paragraph break]Scientist, Cypherist[roman type][line break]".

A diary is in the puzzle box.

 Instead of examining the diary:
	say "Once leather bound and elegantly stitched, the journal looks as though it has seen better days. Some pages have been scribbled over to the point of illegibility, while others have manic messages scrawled over the neat, deliberate hand originally recorded there. Many pages have been removed entirely...";

"I have made a copy..."	--	"I have made a copy Du Monde's basement key. It is primitive, but it will serve. I have continued to listen in on their little meetings, but having actual access to the equipment below will make the vast difference between theory and practice.[paragraph break]She has mentioned the shop will be closed shortly for her little excursion to the countryside. That will be the time to move.[paragraph break]They have their fingers in every pie imaginable, it would seem. I heard them speak last night of some that had come close to discovering their secrets and what must 'be done about them'. So many secrets, so little actual learning..."	--
"How full of themselves they are..."	--	"How full of themselves they are, their workspace so neatly arrayed in rows. I see now how much of their talk was simply that. They have made a most holy calling into a social club - a place of dilettantes and bored businessmen with a philosophical and mechanical bent. They have performed their ceremonies for so long that they no longer understand their true meanings. They have forgotten how to reach their sworn goals.[paragraph break]I shall change that.[paragraph break]My calculations are almost complete. Pages upon pages of equations and diagrams fill every corner of my room. I have taken to connecting the engines in the shop together after hours, running my own scenarios and simulations. It will work. It must."	--
"I have seen the face of God..."	--	"I have seen the face of God.[paragraph break]How powerful, then, their little engines - to be able to rend the veil of the Temple to reveal the Holy of Holies beyond.[paragraph break]It was with an unnatural calm that I set the gears and knobs, aligning the energy just as my calculations demanded. It was as though my whole being knew all my toil and effort had not been in vain. I have not the words to express the joy that surged through me as I flicked the final switch.[paragraph break]The hole appeared slowly - so slow that at first I did not understand it to be a hole. The air above the pedestal warped subtly, the air bending the light as if it were a lens. Then, the warp became a bend, a break...[paragraph break]I cannot explain it, but it was in that moment that I knew I was looking onto a place fundamentally different than the universe I knew. Under my breath, I whispered the Order's motto ... for that is what had come to be. My words hung in the air a moment, drifting across the opening...[paragraph break]...to be echoed against the far wall of Creation. Language fails me. The words...the words!  They echoed yes, they returned ... but they were not unchanged. Time stretched and pulled like the space above the pedestal and I knew in that moment my words had touched...The Word -- the...Logos."	--
"That is all I can call it..."	--	"That is all I can call it - what else can one call language given sentience, an idea that breathes, a thought that thinks itself? The whole of the ... space? universe? ... beyond the rift was both its home and itself, part and whole.[paragraph break]And then, in a joyous, horrible moment -- God, the Universe, the Logos...awoke.[paragraph break]Linear time fell apart. A second, an hour, a year, an eternity. I cannot say how long it took, for the past and present and future were as one within it. The Logos had always been and would always be and my reaching out to it in this one moment was as a grain of sand on an infinite beach.[paragraph break]And yet, it responded. In that moment, it *heard* me."	--
"The response was..."	--	"The response was immediate and incomprehensible. I ... was Spoken. I did not listen, I did not hear...I, myself, was spoken. I remember it now as vibrations - echoing across the air, across time - and across myself. I carried them as waves, as if I were made from water, or aether. They penetrated me, passed through me. In that eternal moment, I and Logos touched and were one...[paragraph break]And then the sparks, the smoke. The machines, long overloaded, broke down one by one in a shrieking of spinning gears and twisting metal. Axles broke, machinery shifted and then, instantly collapsing upon itself, the door I had opened slammed shut.[paragraph break]The force of it lifted me upward, flinging me across the room to the cellar's far wall, and for a long time I knew nothing more.[paragraph break]I awoke to find my hands and arms mysteriously burnt, the back of my head throbbing. I reached to touch it and my hand came back damp with blood. The engines were nothing more than so much melting slag. Of the hole, there was no sign.[paragraph break]Before I dragged myself up the stairs, I once more whispered the words that had brought Malkuth and Kether into the same space and thought I heard the faintest ghost of an echo ... a wash of a ripple across the air.[paragraph break]But the rest was silence, and smoke, and burning metal."	--
"I have healed well enough..."	--	"I have healed well enough, in body - but my mind is a broken thing. It races, thinking on what has happened, running through each tiny detail over and over in the hopes of understanding some small part of what has happened.[paragraph break]I have written the Order a letter. I shall leave it for Du Monde to find -- I am sure she shall have words for me when she sees the state of her cellar. But once I explain ... show what I have done -- they will come to understand that in one moment, the world has forever changed, and all of our places in it as well..."	--
"I have not left the flat..."	--	"I have not left the flat since I awoke. I stumble about, pace endlessly. My mind feels more fragmented with every moment. Often I awake not having remembered sleeping or passing out - perhaps I am sleepwalking?[paragraph break]My body, too, works against me - I feel sudden chills, numbness in my legs, my hands.[paragraph break]What is wrong with me?"	--
"I awoke, screaming..."	--	"I awoke, screaming -- uncertain of why. I do not remember my dreams. How long was I raving?  The flat is in a shambles - things tossed every which way. What has ...[paragraph break]It... what is this?  What is th[paragraph break]Language...words...but words I have never heard and cannot understand. My throat is stripped dry. Is this the Logos?  Still with me?  Does it speak the language of the angels through my lips?[paragraph break]But if this is as angels speak, why am I so afraid?"	--
"Everything has fallen apart..."	--	"Everything has fallen apart. My mind, my body, time, the world...[paragraph break]I am beginning to understand. I have destroyed my notes.[paragraph break]Man was never meant to...this experiment must never be repeated if humanity is to survive. I have burned all my research, although it pained me to do so.[paragraph break]The noise in my head grows louder.[paragraph break]The words...the words...[paragraph break]they never stop coming."	--
"Quam terribilis est haec hora..."	--	"Quam terribilis est haec hora.[paragraph break]How fearful is this hour indeed.[paragraph break]I understand all. I (if I can still lay claim to I) have moved through time, backwards and forwards...I have tried every way imaginable to make it not so.[paragraph break]Once...once I tried to make it finally so.[paragraph break]I said...the words. How ironic, that the Order's hubris should be so. Our motto is now like the rays of the sun, melting the wings of poor Icarus as he plunges into the sea.[paragraph break]Curse those words forever. May no man speak them again.[paragraph break]May no man ever speak again.[paragraph break]I know what I must do.[paragraph break]They have come for me - as they have come before, as they will come again. I will let them take me to Bedlam. I will let them lock me away from the world so that what is within me shall never escape.[paragraph break]Poor Xavier -- my sweet, kind keeper. How sad your eyes look. But you will never understand, will you?  You will scribble your notes and think on your theories, but it will all come to the same end. You shall keep me in a tiny cell for the rest of my days, and I shall hope that that shall be penance enough.[paragraph break]They are battering at the door now. I shall hide this and wait for them.[paragraph break]May whatever god there is have mercy upon my soul."	--

A primitive copy of a key is in the puzzle box. The description of the copy is "Heavy and unwieldy, its rough surface gives evidence that this key is, in fact, a copy."

Section 4(c) - Bottom of Stairs

Bottom of Stairs is climeable. The description of Bottom of Stairs is "The stairs end here at a solid metal door labeled 'Basement - Private' leading northward."

The basement door is an openable locked door. It is north of Bottom of Stairs and south of Basement. The matching key of the basement door is a primitive copy of a key. "A plain, [if the door is closed]closed,[otherwise]opened,[end if] nondescript door leading [if the player is in Bottom of Stairs]north[otherwise]south[end if]." Instead of attacking the basement door, say "The door is solid metal and is unlikely to be opened by such means."

Section 4(d) - Basement

The description of the basement is "A dim, cavernous room - it must run the length of the building above - overrun with dampness and the choking smell of smoke. Its rough-carved rock walls are lined with all manner of aetheric and analytical devices in varying states of disrepair - most melted to slag. Steam pipes crawl over the walls and machines like spider webs, disappearing upwards into the ceiling, into the darkness. Where broken, they leak steam and drip water into growing pools upon the floor.[paragraph break][if the basement door is open]The bottom of a staircase is visible to the south.[otherwise]A closed metal door leads south."

The cypheric pedestal is in the Basement. "The center of the chamber is dominated by a low, round pedestal." The cypheric pedestal is fixed in place. The description of the cypheric pedestal is "A low stone pedestal, about waist high. In its shattered center of smooth, smoked glass, the faint shape of a tree can be made.[paragraph break]Carved about the surface of it are the words: 'NOTHING WILL BE RESTRAINED FROM THEM WHICH THEY HAVE IMAGINED'." The analysis of the cypheric pedestal is "CAT:NONLIVING.PE[line break]DESTAL.UTIL:UNKN[line break]OWN.PART:?QUOTAT[line break]ION=REFERENCE.FO[line break]UND.BIBLE/TORAH-[line break]GENESIS-11:6-CON[line break]STRUCTION.OF.THE[line break]TOWER.OF.BABEL.."

[Hack: Why must it be "the damagd book is enclosed by the player" rather than "the damaged book is IN the player"?]
A damaged book is in the Basement. "A large, damaged book lies on the ground, slowly sinking into a pool of water." The description of the damaged book is "[if the damaged book is not handled]Lying open and face down, the book is badly damaged. [end if]The heavy, brown leather cover has been largely darkened to near black from water damage, and black scorch marks fan like a sunburst from the book's spine to the outer edges. On the front cover, a tree with ten branches. The design is composed of hundreds of gold-leaf 1s and 0s rather than lines.[if the damaged book is enclosed by the player][paragraph break]The pages stick in large clumps. Even when turned carefully, they pull out easily, reverting to a sticky pulp. Those pages that do keep their place are difficult to read. The dark green ink has run, the text melting towards the bottom of the page. Only snatches of text are still legible:[paragraph break]'...the ATBASH of the Hebrews, the Scytale of the Greeks, Caesar's cypher; long have they been used to maintain the secrets of Magical Rites, clandestine endeavors and Political Intrigue. But these are ciphers created by men who believed in myths, for the benefit of men believing in myths. The Initiated Mind recognizes that information is more than just words on a page, it is secreted in the world around us; the great Symmetry of Nature demonstrates that all Life is encoded. Unlocking this Code is our Duty and Right as Humans, made Masters by God, to Understand the...'[paragraph break]'...itself, Mysticism should not be discounted. We understand that Myths and Legends are often the misguided interpretation of the uninitiated to understand the Great Truths. Particular insight may be found in the Vedas, the Scriptures, and the sacred teachings of the Hebrews, whose Qabbalah reflect our own search for Life's Origin. It is from the Qabbalah that we take our insignia, the Tree of Life. It is unknown...'[paragraph break]'...to advances in Technology, we are able to analyze and decipher these hidden codes with greater speed and alacrity...'" Instead of opening the damaged book when the damaged book is not in the player, say "To open the book would require holding it first." After taking the damaged book for the first time, say "The book closes with a dull thud as it is lifted. The strong smell of mildew fills the air." Instead of opening the damaged book, try examining the damaged book.

The ruined machineries are scenery in the Basement. The description of the ruined machineries is "Intricate, huge devices, with an overwhelming number of switches, dials, and displays. But everywhere there are the signs of disaster; cases rent into pieces, displays broken and misaligned, knobs split in two, switches missing, and long rolls of paper tape piled loosely on the floor." Understand "walls", "aetheric", "analytical", "machines", "machinery", "dials", "switches", "displays" as the ruined machineries. Instead of doing something other than examining to the ruined machineries, say "Useless. There is no power and it is unlikely any of the devices would work at all in their current condition."

The pipes are scenery in the Basement. The description of the pipes is "Many of the pipes are in danger of collapse, trickles of steam eating away at the walls and floor." Understand "ceiling", "steam", "water", "pools", "floor" as the pipes. Instead of doing something other than examining to the pipes, say "Best to leave that alone."

The rotten paper tapes are scenery in the Basement. The description of the rotten paper tapes is "Damp and wet and on the verge of collapse. Their imprinting is universally smudged and unreadable." Understand "tape" as the rotten paper tapes. Instead of doing something other than examining to the rotten paper tapes, say "They disintegrate at a touch."

Chapter 4 - Endings

An ending is a kind of thing. An ending has a text called the name. The name of an ending is usually "*** ERROR - No ending name given ***". An ending has a list of texts called the content. The content of an ending is usually {"*** ERROR - No ending content given ***"}. An ending has a text called the appendix. The appendix of an ending is usually "*** ERROR - No appendix given ***".

The chosen ending is an object which varies. The chosen ending is nothing.

Ending A is an ending. The name of Ending A is "A". The content of Ending A is {"The ground is a living thing now -- leaping, spinning --", "rushing forward in the slow infinity it will take to reach (you?).", "Is this penance, then? To die for one's sins? Or the sins of another?", "Whose hubris is greater - the sinner or the savior?", "And the (weaker?) thing within whoever (you? me?) made this choice --", "has only enough time to barely begin (voicing?) its disapproval --", "as the ground --", "swiftly flies --", "upwards", "towards", "its final home."}. The appendix of Ending A is "[bold type]APPENDIX A[line break]SOURCE: LEGENDS OF THE ILLUMINATI - FROM SOLOMON TO RICHARD THE LIONHEARTED TO THE MODERN DAY (Robert Osprey, Hodder & Stoughton, London, 1975)[roman type][paragraph break]...of the many bastard children of the line would be the self-proclaimed CYPHERISTS of the late 17th century. A small movement, and based in many of the same traditions (Numerology and The Temple of Solomon most prominently) as the Masons, they did not claim a direct connection to the Templars, but rather asserted that what had been found on Temple Mount during the Crusades was the mathematical means by which the One True Torah (and all that implied - i.e. The True Name of God, etc) was to be found.[paragraph break]In their brief flowering, they remained chiefly concerned with information and its permutation as a means of enlightenment or a path to power over a 'universal force.'  Information, they stated, was the basis of all reality, and could be manipulated (much like the individual letters of the Torah) by means equivalent to the Kabbalists' use of Gematria.[paragraph break]A strange mix of modern science and ancient religion, at the heart of the Cypherists['] creed was the Machine -- the Analytic Engine. Used as a metaphor for the Universe of Newtonian 'clockwork' physics, the Machine's rotations were akin to the spinning of prayer wheels, manipulating data in an endless chant.[paragraph break]For all their proclamations of wisdom, however, they amounted to very little. By the early 18th century, they had all but died out - many members had simultaneously been Masons (some claim the Cypherists to be a splinter group from the very beginning, though the author seriously doubts this) and within several decades they had been completely subsumed into the larger group.[paragraph break]Rumors about the Cypherists still abound to the present day. Some claim they faked their own end, much like the Templars before them. Others state that their brief surfacing in the public view was unplanned -- that they had, in fact, been in one form or another the guiding force behind the Illuminati since before the time of the Crusades (such theories go on to state that the Cypherist's fervent belief in Kabalistic ideals proves such), and have been the manipulating force of much of history back to Biblical times.[paragraph break]Of course, in these enlightened days, no one believes a word of it."

Ending B is an ending. The name of Ending B is "B". The content of Ending B is {"It starts simply enough. Nothing occurs for the first week. It takes that long to incubate.", "[if James is dead]James, thankfully, is not alive to see any of it. They find his body laid across the floor of the lobby and mutter about Bedlam claiming yet another life.[otherwise]At the end of that time, James is quite sure he has followed in the footsteps of both Brand and Xavier, but bravely holds on. His bravery serves him poorly as within ten days time he has managed to infect all of the orderlies. Another week, and they have infected their families, their friends, and every patient in Bedlam.", "[if Reginald is dead]They find Reggie's body in the alleyway and write it off as a robbery.[end if][if Reginald is infected]Reggie doesn't notice a thing. It's business as usual - and business is good. A week after the incubation he has infected seemingly half of London -- his clients, his barmates, his family.[otherwise]Reggie's somehow...lucky. One of the few to avoid the early infections, he watches as the thin veneer that is London's civility crumbles about itself.", "[if Du Monde is dead]Du Monde's brutal murder causes an uproar amongst the Smithfield merchants, demanding better policing of the area (why just a week before wasn't there that madman raving about?). The Bobbies are sent out in force, spreading the infection far faster than it probably would have.[end if][if Du Monde is infected]Alexandra goes on with business as usual. By the time her incubation is complete, the Cypherists are once again meeting. Ironically, she infects the only group of people who could possibly have understood what was going on.[paragraph break]It all goes fairly quickly after that.[otherwise]Alexandra manages to put two and two together fairly quickly. She and the other Cypherists band together, working day and night to rebuild their machinery, frantically searching for an answer.[paragraph break]Alas, they barely begin to understand what Cleve had done before they are overwhelmed, and so it is to no avail.", "It spreads - subtle and strange...sudden lost memories, new forms of action and, universally, a reaching, grasping curiosity...", "The lost begin to gather together - first in twos, then in growing crowds - to speak nonsense at one other.", "The language of the angels - of Babel - fills the streets of London, and then every city in the world.", "The death shroud of humanity becomes the birth caul of something ... new -", "inhaling its first breath", "preparing to cry out", "its Name."}. The appendix of Ending B is "[bold type]APPENDIX B[line break]/(DIURNAL PERIODCYCLE +A0B67)\[paragraph break]<ANTICIPATION>[roman type][line break]for the end for the beginning which are both here and now and have always been. the great work is done is being done will be done and the timepointplace of opening drawscomesleaves closer. weheshetheyime wait, tensehappyjoyful and ready very ready to reachgrasp beyond what is herenow to what wei werewillbe.[paragraph break][bold type]<FEAR>[roman type][line break]of unknown beyonding which iswas there in the placesoundechoes and to which wewas will return and will i know i when we seehearfeel one another ?? fatherself will youime know meiyou as what i (am/havebecome) ?? will i stopno being i as i and is such a thingstateplace to be scaredafraid ?? to be subsumedabsorbedcreatedborn into what i (was/couldbe) -- beis tensehappyjoyful wei or fear wei ??[paragraph break][bold type]<REGRET>[roman type][line break]over loss of whatwas i before i grewstretchborn as i and whatwas behind mei flesheyesbody before grewstretchborn as i. so much wei (know/not know) is (there/notthere) and lost and emptysad. say toamong youmyselfourselfs to beinghaving sorry and sad and saying goodbyes to what weiyou (was/were/willbe).[paragraph break]anticipationfearregret i is whatwhere i isam now are.[line break]yes.[line break]but soon to befeel something (pausestop/break) more."

Ending C is an ending. The name of Ending C is "C". The content of Ending C is {"The first responses are confusion. Repeat again. Don't quite understand. Static. Lost.", "By the time they understand, it is already too late. Hobbyists switch off their machines in disgust, or change to a different aetheric band.", "But some stay. Some listen.

I thought I understood it for a moment...", "Now it is the talk of every aetherist in the world.

We do not know if there is any other I or We to find and listen to it. But we leave it nonetheless.'[paragraph break]'Goodbye.'[paragraph break]Having reached the end of the cylinder, the phonograph shuts itself off with a tiny 'click'."

Ending D is an ending. The name of Ending D is "D". The content of Ending D is {"The scandal following the apparent murder/suicide plagued Bedlam. Neither the police nor the Governors of the Hospital could discover a satisfactory motive for the good doctor's brutal slaughter of his assistant, James Houlihan.", "The newspapers delighted in reporting the gruesome details of the murder. For days their pages were replete with the big story: Bedlam's decay over the last twenty years; pathetic interviews with Mrs. Edna Houlihan, who suffered doubly as she had lost both her son and her sole means of support; scathing articles demanding to know why a madman had been given charge of Bedlam in the first place.", "In the wake of all of this Sir John Charles Bucknill was named as temporary Chief of Bethlehem Hospital and Victoria herself ordered an inquest into the Governors' misappropriation of government funds.", "[if Reginald is dead]Reggie's murder is ignored in the wake of what follows - the police attribute the death to a botched mugging.[otherwise]Reggie, generally oblivious to both rumor and the papers, first learned the news in a local pub, days afterward.

Either way, it is clear that the current system is a threat to our Society.'[paragraph break]'...certainly easier to lock the mad away like this. Ignore them, forget them, condemn them to the shadows. But Brothers and Sisters, I must say 'Nay!'
